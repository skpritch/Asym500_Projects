The weights in excess are redistributed proportionally among the uncapped developed market Index Components. After the above capping constraints have been satisfied, the weights of all Index Components are subject to a floor of 0.1%.</font></div><div style="margin-bottom:6pt;text-align:justify"><font style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">After the capping and flooring conditions outlined above are satisfied, a group floor is implemented such that the Index has at least 80% of its total weight allocated into securities issued by companies that either i) have a Thematic Exposure of equal to or greater than 50% of their total revenue, or ii) are ranked within the top 5 positions according to their Thematic Revenue Dollar Amount from the Lithium and Battery Metal Mining Industry (collectively, the &#8220;Thematic Exposure Flooring&#8221;). In cases where the Thematic Exposure Flooring cannot be satisfied (i.e. the 80% minimum weight threshold is not achieved), the Thematic Revenue Dollar Amount ranking threshold is relaxed so the companies within the top 10 positions in the ranking satisfy the Thematic Exposure Flooring.

Investments in the securities of foreign issuers (including investments in ADRs and GDRs) are subject to the risks associated with investing in those foreign markets, such as heightened risks of inflation or nationalization. The prices of foreign securities and the prices of U.S. securities have, at times, moved in opposite directions. In addition, securities of foreign issuers may lose value due to political, economic and geographic events affecting a foreign issuer or market. During periods of social, political or economic instability in a country or region, the value of a foreign security traded on U.S. exchanges could be affected by, among other things, increasing price volatility, illiquidity, or the closure of the primary market on which the security (or the security underlying the ADR or GDR) is traded.

This makes Australasian economies susceptible to fluctuations in the commodity markets. Australia&#8217;s economy is also increasingly dependent on its growing service industries. Because the economy of Australia is dependent on the economies of its key trading partners, reduction in spending by any of these trading partners on Australian products and services, or negative changes in any of these economies, may cause an adverse impact on some or all of the Australian economy.</font></div><div style="margin-bottom:6pt;padding-left:72pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:-18pt"><font style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">&#9702;</font><font style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:400;line-height:120%;padding-left:14.46pt">Risk of Investing in China. </font><font style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">The Chinese economy is generally considered an emerging market and can be significantly affected by economic and political conditions in China and surrounding Asian countries and may demonstrate significantly higher volatility from time to time in comparison to developed markets. China may be subject to considerable degrees of economic, political and social instability. Over the last few decades, the Chinese government has undertaken reform of economic and market practices and has expanded the sphere of private ownership of property in China. However, Chinese markets generally continue to experience inefficiency, volatility and pricing anomalies resulting from governmental influence, a lack of publicly available information and&#47;or political and social instability. Chinese companies are also subject to the risk that Chinese authorities can intervene in their operations and structure. In addition, the Chinese economy is export-driven and highly reliant on trading with key partners. A downturn in the economies of China&#8217;s primary trading partners could slow or eliminate the growth of the Chinese economy and adversely impact the Fund&#8217;s investments. The Chinese government strictly regulates the payment of foreign currency denominated obligations and sets monetary policy.</font></div><div style="margin-bottom:6pt;padding-left:36pt;text-align:justify"><font style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">In addition, trade relations between the U.S. and China have recently been strained. Worsening trade relations between the two countries could adversely impact the Fund, particularly to the extent that the Chinese government restricts foreign investments in Chinese companies or the U.S. government restricts investments by U.S. investors in China. There may be companies included in the Index that have at times been, and may in the future be, subject to such restrictions. These recent developments have heightened concerns of increased tariffs and restrictions on trade between the two countries. An increase in tariffs or trade restrictions, or even the threat of such developments, could lead to a significant reduction in international trade, which could have a negative impact on China&#8217;s export industry and a commensurately negative impact on the Fund. Market volatility and volatility in the price of Fund shares may also result.</font></div><div style="margin-bottom:6pt;padding-left:36pt;text-align:justify"><font style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">Disclosure and regulatory standards in emerging market countries, such as China, are in many respects less stringent than U.S. standards. There is substantially less publicly available information about Chinese issuers than there is about U.S. issuers. Chinese companies, including Chinese companies that are listed on U.S. exchanges, are not subject to the same degree of accounting standards or auditor oversight as companies in more developed countries. As a result, information about the Chinese securities in which the Fund invests may be less reliable or complete. Chinese companies with securities listed on U.S. exchanges may be delisted if they do not meet U.S. accounting standards and auditor oversight requirements, such as those mandated by the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act (HFCAA), which would significantly decrease the liquidity and value of the securities. In addition, there may be significant obstacles to obtaining information necessary for investigations into or litigation against Chinese companies, and shareholders may have limited legal remedies. The Fund is not actively managed and does not select investments based on investor protection considerations.</font></div><div style="margin-bottom:6pt;padding-left:36pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:-18pt"><font style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">&#8226;</font><font style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%;padding-left:14.5pt;text-decoration:underline">Risk of Investments in China A-Shares</font><font style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">.

Recently, the A-Shares market has experienced considerable volatility and been subject to frequent and extensive trading halts and suspensions. These trading halts and suspensions have, among other things, contributed to uncertainty in the markets and reduced the liquidity of the securities subject to such trading halts and suspensions. This could cause volatility in the Fund&#8217;s share price and subject the Fund to a greater risk of trading halts.</font></div><div style="margin-bottom:6pt;padding-left:36pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:-18pt"><font style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">&#8226;</font><font style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%;padding-left:14.5pt;text-decoration:underline">Stock Connect Programs Risk</font><font style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">. To the extent the Fund invests in China A-Shares, it expects to do so through the trading and clearing facilities of a participating exchange located outside of mainland China (&#8220;Stock Connect Programs&#8221;). The Stock Connect Programs are subject to daily quota limitations, and an investor cannot purchase and sell the same security on the same trading day, which may restrict the Fund&#8217;s ability to invest in A-Shares through the Programs and to enter into or exit trades on a timely basis. The Shanghai and Shenzhen markets may be open at a time when the participating exchanges located outside of mainland China are not active, with the result that prices of A-Shares may fluctuate at times when the Fund is unable to add to or exit its positions. Only certain China A-Shares are eligible to be accessed through the Stock Connect Programs. Such securities may lose their eligibility at any time, in which case they could be sold but could no longer be purchased through the Stock Connect Programs. Because the Stock Connect Programs are still evolving, the actual effect on the market for trading A-Shares with the introduction of large numbers of foreign investors is still relatively unknown. Further, regulations or restrictions, such as limitations on redemptions or suspension of trading, may adversely impact the program. There is no guarantee that the participating exchanges will continue to support the Stock Connect Programs in the future.</font></div><div style="margin-bottom:6pt;padding-left:36pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:-18pt"><font style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">&#8226;</font><font style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%;padding-left:14.5pt;text-decoration:underline">Tax Risk of Investments in China A-Shares</font><font style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">. The Fund&#8217;s investments in A-Shares will be subject to a number of taxes and tax regulations in China. The application of many of these tax regulations is at present uncertain. Moreover, China has implemented a number of tax reforms in recent years, including the value added tax reform, and may continue to amend or revise existing Chinese tax laws in the future. The Fund&#8217;s investments in securities issued by Chinese companies, including A-Shares, may cause the Fund to become subject to withholding income tax and other taxes imposed by China. Changes in applicable Chinese tax law, particularly taxation on a retrospective basis, could reduce the after-tax profits of the Fund directly or indirectly by reducing the after-tax profits of the companies in China in which the Fund invests and could result in unexpected tax liabilities for the Fund.

If a transaction is particularly large or if the relevant market is or becomes illiquid, it may not be possible to initiate a transaction or liquidate a position, which may cause the Fund to suffer significant losses and difficulties in meeting redemptions. Liquidity risk may be the result of, among other things, market turmoil, the reduced number and capacity of traditional market participants, or the lack of an active trading market. Markets for securities or financial instruments could be disrupted by a number of events, including, but not limited to, an economic crisis, natural disasters, new legislation or regulatory changes inside or outside the U.S. liquid investments may become less liquid after being purchased by the Fund, particularly during periods of market stress. In addition, if a number of securities held by the Fund stop trading, it may have a cascading effect and cause the Fund to halt trading.

Companies engaged in the production and distribution of basic materials may be adversely affected by changes in world events, political and economic conditions, energy conservation, environmental policies, commodity price volatility, changes in exchange rates, imposition of import controls, increased competition, depletion of resources and labor relations. Many companies in this sector are significantly affected by the level and volatility of commodity prices, the exchange value of the dollar, import controls, and worldwide competition. At times, worldwide production of industrial materials has exceeded demand as a result of over-building or economic downturns, leading to poor investment returns or losses. This sector may also be affected by economic cycles, interest rates, resource availability, technical progress, labor relations, and government regulations.</font></div><div style="margin-bottom:6pt;padding-left:36pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:-18pt"><font style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">&#8226;</font><font style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:700;line-height:120%;padding-left:14.5pt">Securities Lending Risk. </font><font style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">To the extent the Fund lends its securities, it may be subject to the following risks&#58; (1) the securities in which the collateral is invested may not perform sufficiently to cover the applicable rebate rates paid to borrowers and related administrative costs&#59; (2) delays may occur in the recovery of securities from borrowers, which could interfere with the Fund&#8217;s ability to vote proxies or to settle transactions&#59; and (3) although borrowers of the Fund&#8217;s securities typically provide collateral in the form of cash that is reinvested in securities, there is the risk of possible loss of rights in the collateral should the borrower fail financially.</font></div><div style="margin-bottom:6pt;padding-left:36pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:-18pt"><font style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">&#8226;</font><font style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:700;line-height:120%;padding-left:14.5pt">Small-Capitalization Investing Risk</font><font style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">.

If the Fund were to distribute to its shareholders less than the minimum amount required for any year, the Fund would become subject to federal income tax for that year on all of its taxable income and recognized gains, even those distributed to its shareholders. In addition, under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the &#8220;Code&#8221;), the Fund may not earn more than 10% of its annual gross income from gains resulting from the sale of commodities and precious metals. This could make it more difficult for the Fund to pursue its investment strategy and maintain qualification as a RIC. In lieu of potential disqualification as a RIC, the Fund is permitted to pay a tax for certain failures to satisfy this income requirement, which, in general, are limited to those due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect.</font></div><div style="margin-bottom:6pt;padding-left:36pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:-18pt"><font style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">&#8226;</font><font style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:700;line-height:120%;padding-left:14.5pt">Thematic Investing Risk. </font><font style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">The Fund relies on the Index Provider for the identification of securities for inclusion in the Index that reflect themes and sub-themes, and its performance may suffer if such securities are not correctly identified or if a theme or sub-theme develops in an unexpected manner. Performance may also suffer if the stocks included in the Index do not benefit from the development of such themes or sub-themes.

In addition, when the Fund uses a representative sampling approach, the Fund may not be as well correlated with the return of the Index as when the Fund purchases all of the securities in the Index in the proportions in which they are represented in the Index.</font></div><div style="margin-bottom:6pt;padding-left:36pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:-18pt"><font style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%">&#8226;</font><font style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:700;line-height:120%;padding-left:14.5pt">Valuation Risk.</font><font style="color:#000000;font-family:'Times New Roman',sans-serif;font-size:10pt;font-weight:400;line-height:120%"> Independent market quotations for certain investments held by the Fund may not be readily available, and such investments may be fair valued or valued by a pricing service at an evaluated price.
