<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">The Fund is an actively-managed exchange-traded
fund (&#8220;ETF&#8221;) that seeks to achieve its investment objective by employing derivatives, namely swap agreements and/or
listed options contracts, to gain long exposure to two underlying securities, Uber Technologies, Inc. (&#8220;UBER&#8221;) and
Tesla, Inc. (&#8220;TSLA&#8221;) (UBER and TSLA, each an &#8220;Underlying Security,&#8221; and together the &#8220;Underlying

the Fund&#8217;s long exposure to TSLA (the &#8220;TSLA strategy&#8221;). Essentially, one dollar invested in the Fund provides
approximately one dollar of exposure to the Fund&#8217;s UBER strategy and approximately one dollar of exposure to the Fund&#8217;s
TSLA strategy. So, the return of the UBER strategy (minus the cost of financing) is essentially stacked on top of the returns of
the TSLA strategy (minus the cost of financing).&#160; Under normal circumstances, the Fund&#8217;s exposure to UBER will represent
approximately 100% of the Fund&#8217;s net assets, and the Fund&#8217;s exposure to TSLA will represent approximately 100% of the
Fund&#8217;s net assets.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">In particular, the term &#8220;exposure&#8221;
refers to the degree to which the Fund&#8217;s investment is influenced by fluctuations in each of the UBER strategy and the TSLA
strategy. If you invest one dollar in the Fund, one dollar&#8217;s worth of that investment will track the performance of the UBER
strategy, behaving similarly to how UBER&#8217;s price performs. In addition, one dollar&#8217;s worth of that investment will
track the performance of the TSLA strategy, mirroring the ups and downs of the price of TSLA. Through the Fund&#8217;s use of leverage,
each dollar invested is effectively doubled to follow and potentially profit (or experience losses) from two different companies.&#160;The
Fund&#8217;s investment strategy is based on the premise that a focused allocation to two companies may provide targeted exposure
to complementary developments and innovations within their respective industries. Through this approach, the Fund seeks to benefit
from each company&#8217;s distinct contributions, leveraging one company&#8217;s expertise in a specific area in conjunction with
the complementary strengths of the other. Specifically, the combination of investing in UBER and TSLA may provide exposure to advancements
in autonomous transportation and sustainable mobility.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">The Fund may enter into one or more
swap agreements with financial institutions whereby the Fund and the financial institution will agree to exchange the return (or
differentials in rates of return) earned or realized on an Underlying Security&#8217;s share price. In addition to utilizing swap
agreements to gain exposure to the Underlying Securities, the Fund may also utilize listed options to seek to achieve exposure
to the Underlying Securities. Additionally, the Fund may use other option strategies to produce similar exposure to an Underlying
Security, like buying calls and selling puts with identical strike prices. These options allow the Fund to adjust its leverage
strategy in response to market conditions, liquidity constraints, or other factors that may affect the availability or pricing
of swap agreements.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">The Fund will hold assets to serve as
collateral for its derivative instruments. For those collateral holdings, the Fund may invest in (1) U.S. Government securities,
such as bills, notes and bonds issued by the U.S. Treasury; (2) money market funds; (3) short term bond ETFs; and/or (4) corporate
debt securities, such as commercial paper and other short-term unsecured promissory notes issued by businesses that are rated investment
grade or of comparable quality.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">Under normal circumstances, the Fund will
invest at least 80% of its net assets, plus borrowings for investment purposes, in financial instruments that provide financial
exposure to UBER and/or TSLA. For purposes of compliance with this investment policy, derivative contracts will be valued at their
notional value. The Fund is expected to have a high annual portfolio turnover rate.</P>

</I>The classification of Uber&#8217;s drivers (&#8220;Drivers&#8221;) is currently being challenged in courts, by legislators
and by government agencies in the United States and abroad. Uber is involved in numerous legal proceedings globally, including
putative class and collective class action lawsuits, demands for arbitration, charges and claims before administrative agencies,
and investigations or audits by labor, social security, and tax authorities that claim that Drivers should be treated as Uber&#8217;s
employees (or as workers or quasi-employees where those statuses exist), rather than as independent contractors. Uber believes
that Drivers are independent contractors because, among other things, they can choose whether, when, and where to provide services
on Uber&#8217;s platform, are free to provide services on competitors&#8217; platforms, and provide a vehicle to perform services
on Uber&#8217;s platform. Nevertheless, Uber may not be successful in defending the classification of Drivers in some or all jurisdictions.
Furthermore, the costs associated with defending, settling, or resolving pending and future lawsuits (including demands for arbitration)
relating to the classification of Drivers have been and may continue to be material to Uber&#8217;s business.</P>

The stock market in general, and the market for technology companies in particular, has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations
that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. In particular, a large proportion

future growth and success of Tesla, Inc. are dependent upon consumers&#8217; demand for electric vehicles, and specifically, its
vehicles in an automotive industry that is generally competitive, cyclical and volatile. If the market for electric vehicles in
general and Tesla, Inc. vehicles in particular does not develop as Tesla, Inc. expects, develops more slowly than it expects, or
if demand for its vehicles decreases in its markets or its vehicles compete with each other, the business, prospects, financial
condition and operating results of Tesla, Inc. may be harmed. Tesla, Inc. is still at an earlier stage of development and have
limited resources and production relative to established competitors that offer internal combustion engine vehicles. In addition,
electric vehicles still comprise a small percentage of overall vehicle sales. As a result, the market for Tesla, Inc. vehicles
could be negatively affected by numerous factors, such as: (i) perceptions about electric vehicle features, quality, safety, performance
and cost; (ii) perceptions about the limited range over which electric vehicles may be driven on a single battery charge, and access
to charging facilities; (iii) competition, including from other types of alternative fuel vehicles, plug-in hybrid electric vehicles
and high fuel-economy internal combustion engine vehicles; (iv) volatility in the cost of oil and gasoline, such as wide fluctuations
in crude oil prices; (v) government regulations and economic incentives; and (vi) concerns about the future viability of Tesla,
Inc. Finally, the target demographics for Tesla, Inc. vehicles are highly competitive. Sales of vehicles in the automotive industry
tend to be cyclical in many markets, which may expose Tesla, Inc. to further volatility.</P>

automotive industry can be highly cyclical, and companies in the industry may suffer periodic operating losses. Automotive companies
can be significantly affected by labor relations, fluctuating component prices and supplier disruptions. Developments in automotive
technologies (e.g., autonomous vehicle technologies) may require significant capital expenditures that may not generate profits
for several years, if ever. Automotive companies may be significantly subject to government policies and regulations regarding
imports and exports of automotive products. Governmental policies affecting the automotive industry, such as taxes, tariffs, duties,
subsidies, and import and export restrictions on automotive products can influence industry profitability. In addition, such companies
must comply with environmental laws and regulations, for which there may be severe consequences for non-compliance. While most
of the major automotive manufacturers are large companies, certain others may be non-diversified in both product line and customer
base and may be more vulnerable to certain events that may negatively impact the automotive industry.</P>

derivative investments carry risks such as an imperfect match between the derivative&#8217;s performance and its underlying assets
or index, and the potential for loss of principal, which can exceed the initial investment. Additionally, there are risks related
to the possible default of the transaction&#8217;s counterparty and the illiquidity of derivatives, making them hard to sell or
trade. If a counterparty becomes bankrupt or otherwise fails to perform its obligations under a derivative contract due to financial
difficulties, the Fund may experience significant delays in obtaining any recovery under the derivative contract in a bankruptcy
or other reorganization proceeding. The derivatives used by the Fund may give rise to a form of leverage. Leverage magnifies the
potential for gain and the risk of loss. Certain of the Fund&#8217;s transactions in derivatives could also affect the amount,
timing, and character of distributions to shareholders, which may result in the Fund realizing more short-term capital gain and
ordinary income subject to tax at ordinary income tax rates than it would if it did not engage in such transactions, which may

of swap transactions is a highly specialized activity, which involves investment techniques and risks different from those associated
with ordinary portfolio securities transactions. Whether the Fund will be successful in using swap agreements to achieve its investment
goal depends on the ability of the Adviser to structure such swap agreements in accordance with the Fund&#8217;s investment objective
and to identify counterparties for those swap agreements. If the Adviser is unable to enter into swap agreements that provide leveraged
exposure to an Underlying Security, the Fund may not meet its stated investment objective. Additionally, any financing, borrowing
or other costs associated with using swap transactions may also have the effect of lowering the Fund&#8217;s return.</P>

the Fund invests are generally traded in the over-the-counter market, which generally has less transparency than exchange-traded
derivatives instruments. In a standard swap transaction, two parties agree to exchange the return (or differentials in rates of
return) earned or realized on particular predetermined reference assets or underlying securities or instruments. The gross return
to be exchanged or swapped between the parties is calculated based on a notional amount or the return on or change in value of
a particular dollar amount invested in a basket of securities.</P>

a dramatic move that causes a material decline in the Fund&#8217;s net assets, the terms of a swap agreement between the Fund and
its counterparty may permit the counterparty to immediately close out the swap transaction with the Fund. In that event, the Fund
may be unable to enter into another swap agreement or invest in other derivatives to achieve exposure consistent with the Fund&#8217;s
investment objective. This may prevent the Fund from achieving its leveraged investment objective, even if the Underlying Security
later reverses all or a portion of its movement.</P>

use of options contracts involves investment strategies and risks different from those associated with ordinary portfolio securities
transactions. The prices of options are volatile and are influenced by, among other things, actual and anticipated changes in the
value of the underlying instrument, including the anticipated volatility, which are affected by fiscal and monetary policies and
by national and international political, changes in the actual or implied volatility or the reference asset, the time remaining
until the expiration of the option contract and economic events. The value of the options contracts in which the Fund invests are
substantially influenced by the value of the Underlying Security. The Fund may experience substantial downside from specific option
positions and certain option positions held by the Fund may expire worthless. The options held by the Fund are exercisable at the
strike price on their expiration date. As an option approaches its expiration date, its value typically increasingly moves with
the value of the underlying instrument. However, prior to such date, the value of an option generally does not increase or decrease
at the same rate as the underlying instrument. There may at times be an imperfect correlation between the movement in values options
contracts and the underlying instrument, and there may at times not be a liquid secondary market for certain options contracts.
The value of the options held by the Fund will be determined based on market quotations or other recognized pricing methods. Additionally,
as the Fund intends to continuously maintain indirect exposure to the Underlying Securities through the use of options contracts,
as the options contracts it holds are exercised or expire it will enter into new options contracts, a practice referred to as &#8220;rolling.&#8221;
If the expiring options contracts do not generate proceeds enough to cover the cost of entering into new options contracts, the
Fund may experience losses. The use of options to generate leverage introduces additional risks, including significant potential
losses if the market moves unfavorably. The leverage inherent in options can amplify both gains and losses, leading to increased
volatility and potential for substantial losses, particularly in periods of market uncertainty or low liquidity. Additionally,
the Fund may incur losses if the value of an Underlying Security moves against its positions, potentially resulting in a complete
loss of the premium paid.</P>

their drivers are classified as employees, workers or quasi-employees instead of independent contractors. This industry is highly

be highly cyclical, and companies in the industry may suffer periodic operating losses. The industry can be significantly affected
by labor relations and fluctuating component prices. While most of the major manufacturers are large, financially strong companies,
many others are small and can be non-diversified in both product line and customer base. Additionally, developments in automotive
technologies (e.g.,&#160;autonomous vehicle technologies) may require significant capital expenditures that may not generate profits
for several years, if any. Companies in the automobiles industry may be significantly subject to government policies and regulations
regarding imports and exports of automotive products. Governmental policies affecting the automotive industry, such as taxes, tariffs,
duties, subsidies, and import and export restrictions on automotive products can influence industry profitability. In addition,
such companies must comply with environmental laws and regulations, for which there may be severe consequences for non-compliance.</P>

risk is the likelihood or probability that a party involved in a transaction might default on its contractual obligation. Where
the Fund enters into derivative contracts that are exchange-traded, the Fund is subject to the counterparty risk associated with
the Fund&#8217;s clearing broker or clearinghouse. Relying on a counterparty exposes the Fund to the risk that a counterparty will
not settle a transaction in accordance with its terms and conditions because of a dispute over the terms of the contract (whether
or not bona fide) or because of a credit or liquidity problem, thus causing the Fund to suffer a loss. If a counterparty defaults
on its payment obligations to the Fund, this default will cause the value of an investment in the Fund to decrease. In addition,
to the extent the Fund deals with a limited number of counterparties, it will be more susceptible to the credit risks associated
with those counterparties.</P>

        not have recognized if it had made a redemption in-kind. As a result, the Fund may pay out higher annual capital gain distributions
        than if the in-kind redemption process was used. By paying out higher annual capital gain distributions, investors may be subjected
        to increased capital gains taxes. Brokerage costs could be imposed on the Fund, and thus decrease the Fund&#8217;s net asset value,

In addition, secondary market investors will also incur the cost of the bid-ask spread. The bid-ask spread varies over time for Shares based on trading volume and market liquidity, and is generally lower if Shares have more trading volume and market liquidity and higher if Shares have little trading volume and market liquidity. Further, a relatively small investor base in the Fund, asset swings in the Fund and/or increased market volatility may cause increased bid-ask spreads. Due to the costs of buying or selling Shares, including bid-ask spreads, frequent trading of Shares may significantly reduce investment results and an investment in Shares may not be advisable for investors who anticipate regularly making small investments.</FONT></TD></TR>

global events such as war, military conflicts, acts of terrorism, natural disasters, the spread of infectious illness or other
public health issues, or other events could have a significant impact on the Fund and its investments. Continuing uncertainties
regarding interest rates, rising inflation, political events, rising government debt in the U.S. and trade tensions also contribute

and between Israel and Hamas in the Middle East could have severe adverse effects on the related region, including significant
adverse effects on the regional or global economies and the markets for certain securities. The U.S. and the European Union have
imposed sanctions on certain Russian individuals and companies, including certain financial institutions, and have limited certain
exports and imports to and from Russia. These conflicts have contributed to recent market volatility and may continue to do so.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">&#160;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">The Fund issues and redeems Shares at NAV
only in large blocks known as &#8220;Creation Units,&#8221; which only APs (typically, broker-dealers) may purchase or redeem.
The Fund generally issues and redeems Creation Units in exchange for a portfolio of securities (the Deposit Securities) and/or
a designated amount of U.S. cash.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">&#160;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">Shares are listed on a national securities
exchange, such as the Exchange, and individual Shares may only be bought and sold in the secondary market through brokers at market
prices, rather than NAV. Because Shares trade at market prices rather than NAV, Shares may trade at a price greater than NAV (premium)
or less than NAV (discount).</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">&#160;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">An investor may incur costs attributable
to the difference between the highest price a buyer is willing to pay to purchase Shares (the &#8220;bid&#8221; price) and the
lowest price a seller is willing to accept for Shares (the &#8220;ask&#8221; price) when buying or selling Shares in the secondary
market. This difference in bid and ask prices is often referred to as the bid-ask spread.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">Fund distributions are generally taxable
to shareholders as ordinary income or capital gains (or some combination thereof), unless your investment is in an individual retirement
account (&#8220;IRA&#8221;) or other tax-advantaged account. Distributions on investments made through tax-deferred arrangements
may be taxed later upon withdrawal of assets from those accounts.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">&#160;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">If you purchase Shares through a broker-dealer
or other financial intermediary (such as a bank) (an &#8220;Intermediary&#8221;), the Adviser or its affiliates may pay Intermediaries
for certain activities related to the Fund, including participation in activities that are designed to make Intermediaries more
knowledgeable about exchange-traded products, including the Fund, or for other activities, such as marketing, educational training,
or other initiatives related to the sale or promotion of Shares. These payments may create a conflict of interest by influencing
the Intermediary and your salesperson to recommend the Fund over another investment. Any such arrangements will not result in increased
Fund expenses, ask your salesperson or visit the Intermediary&#8217;s website for more information.</P>
