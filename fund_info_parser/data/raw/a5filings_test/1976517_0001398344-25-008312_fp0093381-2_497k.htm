<P STYLE="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in">The Fund seeks to achieve its
investment objectives through the use of a synthetic covered call strategy that provides current income on a weekly basis, while also
providing exposure to the price return of one or more exchange-traded funds (&ldquo;ETFs&rdquo;) that hold bitcoin and whose shares trade
on a U.S.-regulated securities exchange (each, a &ldquo;Bitcoin ETF,&rdquo; and collectively, the &ldquo;Bitcoin ETFs&rdquo;). In effectuating
its investment strategy, the Fund will purchase and sell a combination of call and put option contracts that utilize a Bitcoin ETF or
an index of Bitcoin ETFs (the &ldquo;Bitcoin ETF Index&rdquo;) as the reference asset (&ldquo;Bitcoin ETF Options&rdquo;). The Fund will
invest at least 80% of its net assets (plus any borrowings for investment purposes) in Bitcoin ETF Options. For purposes of compliance
with this investment policy, derivative contracts will be valued at their notional value. The Fund&rsquo;s sale of call Bitcoin ETF Options
(&ldquo;Bitcoin ETF Call Options&rdquo;) to generate income will potentially limit the degree to which the Fund will participate in any
gains experienced by the Bitcoin ETFs. <B><U>The Fund does not invest directly in bitcoin</U>.</B></P>

(&ldquo;FLEX Options&rdquo;). The Fund will only invest in options contracts that are listed for trading on regulated U.S. exchanges.
Traditional exchange-traded options have standardized terms, such as the type (call or put), the reference asset, the strike price and
expiration date. Exchange-listed options contracts are guaranteed for settlement by the Options Clearing Corporation (&ldquo;OCC&rdquo;).
FLEX Options are a type of exchange-listed options contract with uniquely customizable terms that allow investors to customize key terms
like type, strike price and expiration date that are standardized in a typical options contract. FLEX Options are also guaranteed for
settlement by the OCC.</FONT></P>

<P STYLE="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in">In general, an option is a contract
that gives the purchaser (holder) of the option, in return for a premium, the right to buy from (call) or sell to (put) the seller (writer)
of the option the security underlying (in this case, a Bitcoin ETF or an index of Bitcoin ETFs) the option at a specified exercise price.
For physically settled options, the writer of an option has the obligation upon exercise of the option to deliver the underlying security
upon payment of the exercise price (call) or to pay the exercise price upon delivery of the underlying security (put). For cash settled
options, the writer of an option has the obligation upon exercise of the option to deliver cash equivalent to the difference between the
strike price and the price of the underlying security.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in">In a traditional covered call
strategy, an investor (such as the Fund) sells a call option on a security it already owns. However, although the Fund may hold some shares
of one or more Bitcoin ETFs, it will primarily derive its exposure to Bitcoin ETFs through Bitcoin ETF Options. It is this distinction
that causes the Fund&rsquo;s strategy to be properly termed as a &ldquo;synthetic covered call strategy&rdquo; as opposed to a traditional
covered call strategy, because the Fund primarily has synthetic exposure to a Bitcoin ETF. The Fund&rsquo;s synthetic exposure to Bitcoin
ETFs is achieved through the combination of purchasing call options and selling put options generally at the same strike price which synthetically
creates the upside and downside participation in the price returns of a Bitcoin ETF or an index of Bitcoin ETFs. The Fund will primarily
gain exposure to increases in value experienced by the Bitcoin ETFs through the purchase of Bitcoin ETF Call Options. As a buyer of these
options, the Fund pays a premium to the seller of the options. The Fund will primarily gain exposure to decreases in value experienced
by the Bitcoin ETFs through the sale of put Bitcoin ETF Options (&ldquo;Bitcoin ETF Put Options&rdquo;). As the seller of these options,
the Fund receives a premium from the buyer of the options. In combination, the purchased Bitcoin ETF Call Options and sold Bitcoin ETF
Put Options generally provide exposure to price returns of the Bitcoin ETF(s) both on the upside and downside.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in">As the primary means by which
the Fund intends to generate income, the Fund will sell Bitcoin ETF Call Options at a strike price that is out-of-the-money. However,
it is important to note that the sale of these call options to generate income will limit the Fund&rsquo;s ability to participate in increases
in value of the Bitcoin ETFs beyond a certain point. If the value of the Bitcoin ETFs increases, the above-referenced synthetic long exposure
would allow the Fund to experience similar percentage gains. However, if the value of the Bitcoin ETFs appreciates in value beyond the
strike price of one or more of the Bitcoin ETF Call Options that the Fund has sold to generate income, the Fund will lose money on those
short call positions, and the losses will, in turn, limit the upside return of the Fund&rsquo;s synthetic long exposure. As a result,
the Fund&rsquo;s overall strategy (<I>i.e.</I>, the combination of the synthetic long exposure to the Bitcoin ETFs and the sold Bitcoin
ETF Call Options) will limit the Fund&rsquo;s participation in gains of the Bitcoin ETFs beyond a certain point. This strategy effectively
converts a portion of the potential upside price return growth of the Bitcoin ETFs into current income. It is expected that the Bitcoin
ETF Call Options the Fund will sell to generate options premiums will generally have expirations of approximately one week or less and
will be held to or close to expiration. The Fund intends to make weekly distribution payments to shareholders.</P>

the Fund may also utilize reverse repurchase agreements to help maintain the desired level of exposure to Bitcoin ETF Options.</P>

operates on cryptographic protocols. The ownership of bitcoin is determined by participants in the Bitcoin network. The Bitcoin network
connects computers that run publicly accessible, or &ldquo;open source,&rdquo; software that follows the rules and procedures governing
the Bitcoin network. This is commonly referred to as the Bitcoin Protocol. Bitcoin, the asset, plays a key role in the operation of the
Bitcoin network, as the computers (or &ldquo;miners&rdquo;) that process transactions on the network and maintain the network&rsquo;s
security are compensated through the issuance of new bitcoin and through transaction fees paid by users in bitcoin.</P>

is collectively maintained by a decentralized user base. The Bitcoin network is accessed through software, and software governs the creation,

in part, by the supply of, and demand for, bitcoin in the global markets for trading bitcoin, market expectations for the adoption of
bitcoin as a decentralized store of value, the number of merchants and/or institutions that accept bitcoin as a form of payment and the
volume of private end-user-to-end-user transactions.</P>

value or underperform other investments. In addition, local, regional or global events such as war, acts of terrorism, market manipulation,
government defaults, government shutdowns, regulatory actions, political changes, diplomatic developments, the imposition of sanctions
and other similar measures, spread of infectious diseases or other public health issues, recessions, natural disasters, or other events
could have a significant negative impact on the Fund and its investments. Any of such circumstances could have a materially negative impact
on the value of Fund Shares, the liquidity of an investment, and may result in increased market volatility. During any such events, Fund
Shares may trade at increased premiums or discounts to their net asset value, the bid/ask spread on Fund Shares may widen and the returns

A covered call strategy involves writing (selling) covered call options in return for the receipt of premiums. The seller of the option
gives up the opportunity to benefit from price increases in the underlying instrument above the exercise price of the options, but continues
to bear the risk of underlying instrument price declines. The premiums received from the options may not be sufficient to offset any losses
sustained from underlying instrument price declines, over time. As a result, the risks associated with writing covered call options may
be similar to the risks associated with writing put options. Exchanges may suspend the trading of options during periods of abnormal market
volatility. Suspension of trading may mean that an option seller is unable to sell options at a time that may be desirable or advantageous
to do so.</P>

of options involves investment strategies and risks different from those associated with ordinary portfolio securities transactions and
depends on the ability of the Fund&rsquo;s portfolio managers to forecast market movements correctly. The prices of options are volatile
and are influenced by, among other things, actual and anticipated changes in the value of the underlying instrument, or in interest or
currency exchange rates, including the anticipated volatility, which in turn are affected by fiscal and monetary policies and by national
and international political and economic events. The effective use of options also depends on the Fund&rsquo;s ability to terminate option
positions at times deemed desirable to do so. There is no assurance that the Fund will be able to effect closing transactions at any particular
time or at an acceptable price. In addition, there may at times be an imperfect correlation between the movement in values of options
and their underlying securities and there may at times not be a liquid secondary market for certain options.</P>

to buy or sell a position at the desired price. Market disruptions or volatility can also make it difficult to find a counterparty willing
to transact at a reasonable price and sufficient size. Illiquid markets may cause losses, which could be significant. The large size of
the positions which the Fund may acquire increases the risk of illiquidity, may make its positions more difficult to liquidate, and may
increase the losses incurred while trying to do so. Such large positions also may impact the price of Bitcoin ETF Options.</P>

Bitcoin remains a volatile and evolving asset subject to significant market fluctuations, uncertainty, and speculative investment interest.
Although increased institutional adoption and regulatory clarity have recently improved market stability and broader acceptance, the value
of bitcoin continues to be influenced substantially by market sentiment, speculative demand, and macroeconomic factors rather than traditional
fundamental analysis alone. The further development and sustained acceptance of the Bitcoin network are dependent on a variety of complex
factors, including technological advancements, regulatory developments, institutional participation, and broader public adoption. While
regulatory oversight of bitcoin and related digital assets has notably increased, particularly in jurisdictions like the United States
and Europe, the global regulatory landscape remains fragmented. Sudden or significant regulatory actions&mdash;including new legislation,
enforcement actions against key market participants, or policy shifts&mdash;can still materially impact bitcoin&rsquo;s valuation and
liquidity. Bitcoin markets remain susceptible to manipulation, fraud, theft, cybersecurity incidents, and operational disruptions, especially
on trading platforms that lack robust regulatory oversight or proper cybersecurity standards. Furthermore, a significant concentration
of bitcoin holdings among a limited number of large holders, often referred to as &ldquo;whales,&rdquo; continues to pose risks of price
volatility or manipulation through coordinated transactions. Technological risks remain inherent in bitcoin and its underlying blockchain
network. While advancements such as Layer 2 scaling solutions (<I>e.g.</I>, the Lightning Network) have made meaningful progress toward
addressing scalability and usability concerns, these technologies are still evolving and carry risks of technical vulnerabilities, hacking,
and operational failures that may undermine confidence or negatively affect bitcoin&rsquo;s value. The potential for blockchain forks&mdash;where
disagreements among developers and stakeholders lead to competing blockchains&mdash;continues to exist. Although fewer contentious forks
have occurred in recent times, such events could reoccur, introducing market confusion, diluting value, or weakening confidence in the
Bitcoin blockchain. Competition from alternative blockchain networks and digital assets remains strong. Networks like Ethereum and other
blockchain platforms with smart contract capabilities, privacy features, or superior scalability may attract broader adoption, thereby
reducing bitcoin&rsquo;s relative attractiveness or limiting its potential as an alternative payment system or digital store of value.
Any of these risks, individually or collectively, could materially and adversely affect the acceptance and market value of bitcoin, consequently
impacting the value of shares in Bitcoin ETFs or related investment products.</P>

Security breaches, computer malware and computer hacking attacks have been a prevalent concern in relation to digital assets. The bitcoin
held by the Bitcoin ETFs&rsquo; custodian will likely be an appealing target to hackers or malware distributors seeking to destroy, damage
or steal the Bitcoin ETFs&rsquo; bitcoins. To the extent that the Bitcoin ETFs and their service providers are unable to identify and
mitigate or stop new security threats or otherwise adapt to technological changes in the digital asset industry, a Bitcoin ETF&rsquo;s
bitcoins may be subject to theft, loss, destruction or other attack. The Bitcoin ETFs have put security procedures in place to prevent
such theft, loss or destruction, including but not limited to, offline storage, or cold storage, multiple encrypted private key &ldquo;shards&rdquo;,
and other measures. Nevertheless, the security procedures cannot guarantee the prevention of any loss due to a security breach, software
defect or act of God that may be borne by the Bitcoin ETFs and the security procedures may not protect against all errors, software flaws
or other vulnerabilities in a Bitcoin ETF&rsquo;s technical infrastructure, which could result in theft, loss or damage of its assets.
The Bitcoin ETFs do not control the operations of their service providers or their implementation of such security procedures and there
can be no assurance that such security procedures will actually work as designed or prove to be successful in safeguarding a Bitcoin ETF&rsquo;s
assets against all possible sources of theft, loss or damage. Assets not held in cold storage, such as assets held in a trading account,
may be more vulnerable to security breach, hacking or loss than assets held in cold storage. Furthermore, assets held in a trading account
are held on an omnibus, rather than segregated basis, which creates greater risk of loss. The security procedures and operational infrastructure
may be breached due to the actions of outside parties, error or malfeasance of an employee of a Bitcoin ETF&rsquo;s service providers,
and, as a result, an unauthorized party may obtain access to the Bitcoin ETF&rsquo;s account at the custodian where its bitcoin is held,
the relevant private keys (and therefore bitcoin) or other data or property of a Bitcoin ETF. Additionally, outside parties may attempt
to fraudulently induce employees of a Bitcoin ETF or its service providers to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to
a Bitcoin ETF&rsquo;s infrastructure. As the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems
change frequently, or may be designed to remain dormant until a predetermined event and often are not recognized until launched against
a target, a Bitcoin ETF and its service providers may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures.</P>

PLATFORMS RISK</B>. Digital asset trading platforms remain relatively new and vary significantly in terms of regulation, transparency,
operational stability, and compliance standards. While certain prominent trading platforms&mdash;particularly those based in the United
States&mdash;have substantially improved transparency, compliance, and regulatory adherence, many platforms still operate internationally
or offshore with significantly less stringent oversight. Platforms located outside the United States may be subject to minimal or inconsistent
regulatory enforcement and often do not provide sufficient public information regarding their management structure, ownership, financial
stability, cybersecurity practices, or compliance controls. Despite increased institutional involvement, enhanced security measures, and
more standardized operating practices adopted by leading platforms, digital asset exchanges continue to be vulnerable to cybersecurity
threats, hacking incidents, fraudulent activities, operational disruptions, and other technical risks. High-profile failures, breaches,
or shutdowns of major trading platforms or custodians&mdash;such as those arising from fraud, cybersecurity incidents, regulatory enforcement
actions, or insolvency&mdash;can significantly reduce investor confidence, increase market volatility, and potentially trigger contagion
effects across the digital asset ecosystem. Regulatory developments and enforcement actions continue to shape the landscape in which digital
asset platforms operate. Recent regulatory scrutiny has heightened globally, particularly in jurisdictions with substantial trading volumes,
such as the United States, Europe, and Asia. Increased regulatory oversight, while potentially positive for market stability in the long
run, can create short-term disruption, reduce liquidity, prompt platform closures, or alter business models substantially, thereby affecting
the prices of digital assets, including bitcoin. Investors should be aware that trading or custodying bitcoin on less transparent or poorly
regulated platforms increases the risk of losing access to digital assets due to platform insolvency, hacking incidents, regulatory intervention,
or operational failure. Although improvements have been made, the digital asset marketplace remains inherently riskier than traditional
financial markets, and investors may have limited recourse if a digital asset trading platform fails or is compromised.</P>

is subject to trading halts caused by extraordinary market volatility pursuant to an exchange&rsquo;s &ldquo;circuit breaker&rdquo; rules.
Shares of a Bitcoin ETF may be at a higher risk of a trading halt due to the volatility of bitcoin. In the event that shares of a Bitcoin

The price of bitcoin remains highly volatile and subject to significant price fluctuations. While recent increases in institutional adoption,
clearer regulatory frameworks, and broader market acceptance have contributed to greater stability relative to earlier periods, the price
of bitcoin continues to be influenced by rapid shifts in market sentiment, regulatory developments, macroeconomic conditions, technological
advancements, and unforeseen events. The market price of bitcoin has historically experienced dramatic highs and lows over short periods,
often with limited or no identifiable catalyst. Given the evolving nature of digital asset markets, price volatility may be amplified
by external factors such as changes in global financial markets, geopolitical events, regulatory enforcement actions, or significant technological
or security incidents. Furthermore, speculative trading, leveraged positions, and derivatives markets tied to bitcoin continue to contribute
to potential volatility. Investors should remain aware that sudden, substantial price movements may occur at any time, potentially leading
to significant losses. Consequently, investments linked directly or indirectly to bitcoin, including Bitcoin ETFs, may experience heightened
volatility compared to traditional investment products.</P>

MEMBER DEFAULT RISK</B>. </FONT>Transactions in some types of derivatives, including the options held by the Fund, are required to be
centrally cleared (&ldquo;cleared derivatives&rdquo;). In a transaction involving cleared derivatives, the Fund&rsquo;s counterparty is
a clearinghouse, such as the OCC, rather than a bank or broker. Since the Fund is not a member of clearinghouses, and only members of
a clearinghouse (&ldquo;clearing members&rdquo;) can participate directly in the clearinghouse, the Fund will hold cleared derivatives
through accounts at clearing members. With regard its cleared derivatives positions, the Fund will make payments (including margin payments)
to, and receive payments from, a clearinghouse through their accounts at clearing members. Customer funds held at a clearing organization
in connection with any option contracts are held in a commingled omnibus account and are not identified to the name of the clearing member&rsquo;s
individual customers. As a result, assets deposited by the Fund with any clearing member as margin for its options position may, in certain
circumstances, be used to satisfy losses of other clients of the Fund&rsquo;s clearing member. In addition, although clearing members
guarantee performance of their clients&rsquo; obligations to the clearinghouse, there is a risk that the assets of the Fund might not
be fully protected in the event of the clearing member&rsquo;s bankruptcy. The Fund is also subject to the risk that a limited number
of clearing members are willing to transact on the Fund&rsquo;s behalf, which heightens the risks associated with a clearing member&rsquo;s
default. If a clearing member defaults, the Fund could lose some or all of the benefits of a transaction entered into by the Fund with
the clearing member. The loss of a clearing member for the Fund to transact with could result in increased transaction costs and other
operational issues that could impede the Fund&rsquo;s ability to implement its investment strategy. If the Fund cannot find a clearing

MARKET CONDITIONS RISK</B>. </FONT>Current market conditions risk is the risk that a particular investment, or Fund Shares in general,
may fall in value due to current market conditions. As a means to fight inflation, which remains at elevated levels, the Federal Reserve
and certain foreign central banks have raised interest rates; however, the Federal Reserve has recently lowered interest rates and may
continue to do so. U.S. regulators have proposed several changes to market and issuer regulations which would directly impact the Fund,
and any regulatory changes could adversely impact the Fund&rsquo;s ability to achieve its investment strategies or make certain investments.
Recent and potential future bank failures could result in disruption to the broader banking industry or markets generally and reduce confidence
in financial institutions and the economy as a whole, which may also heighten market volatility and reduce liquidity. Additionally, challenges
in commercial real estate markets, including rising interest rates, declining valuations and increasing vacancies, could have a broader
impact on financial markets. The ongoing adversarial political climate in the United States, as well as political and diplomatic events
both domestic and abroad, have and may continue to have an adverse impact the U.S. regulatory landscape, markets and investor behavior,
which could have a negative impact on the Fund&rsquo;s investments and operations. The change in administration resulting from the 2024
United States national elections could result in significant impacts to international trade relations, tax and immigration policies, and
other aspects of the national and international political and financial landscape, which could affect, among other things, inflation and
the securities markets generally. Other unexpected political, regulatory and diplomatic events within the U.S. and abroad may affect investor
and consumer confidence and may adversely impact financial markets and the broader economy. For example, ongoing armed conflicts between
Russia and Ukraine in Europe and among Israel, Iran, Hamas and other militant groups in the Middle East, have caused and could continue
to cause significant market disruptions and volatility within the markets in Russia, Europe, the Middle East and the United States. The
hostilities and sanctions resulting from those hostilities have and could continue to have a significant impact on certain Fund investments
as well as Fund performance and liquidity. The economies of the United States and its trading partners, as well as the financial markets
generally, may be adversely impacted by trade disputes, including the imposition of tariffs, and other matters. For example, the United
States has imposed trade barriers and restrictions on China. In addition, the Chinese government is engaged in a longstanding dispute
with Taiwan, continually threatening an invasion. If the political climate between the United States and China does not improve or continues
to deteriorate, if China were to attempt invading Taiwan, or if other geopolitical conflicts develop or worsen, economies, markets and
individual securities may be adversely affected, and the value of the Fund&rsquo;s assets may go down. A public health crisis and the
ensuing policies enacted by governments and central banks may cause significant volatility and uncertainty in global financial markets,
negatively impacting global growth prospects. As the COVID-19 global pandemic illustrated, such events may affect certain geographic regions,
countries, sectors and industries more significantly than others. Advancements in technology may also adversely impact markets and the
overall performance of the Fund. For instance, the economy may be significantly impacted by the advanced development and increased regulation
of artificial intelligence. Additionally, cyber security breaches of both government and non-government entities could have negative impacts
on infrastructure and the ability of such entities, including the Fund, to operate properly. These events, and any other future events,
may adversely affect the prices and liquidity of the Fund&rsquo;s portfolio investments and could result in disruptions in the trading
markets.</P>

Investments in debt securities subject the holder to the credit risk of the issuer. Credit risk refers to the possibility that the issuer
or other obligor of a security will not be able or willing to make payments of interest and principal when due. Generally, the value of
debt securities will change inversely with changes in interest rates. To the extent that interest rates rise, certain underlying obligations
may be paid off substantially slower than originally anticipated and the value of those securities may fall sharply. During periods of
falling interest rates, the income received by the Fund may decline. If the principal on a debt security is prepaid before expected, the
prepayments of principal may have to be reinvested in obligations paying interest at lower rates. Debt securities generally do not trade
on a securities exchange making them generally less liquid and more difficult to value than common stock.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in"><B>DERIVATIVES RISK</B>. The
use of derivative instruments involves risks different from, or possibly greater than, the risks associated with investing directly in
securities and other traditional investments. These risks include: (i) the risk that the counterparty to a derivative transaction may
not fulfill its contractual obligations; (ii) risk of mispricing or improper valuation; and (iii) the risk that changes in the value of
the derivative may not correlate perfectly with the underlying asset. Derivative prices are highly volatile and may fluctuate substantially
during a short period of time. Such prices are influenced by numerous factors that affect the markets, including, but not limited to:
changing supply and demand relationships; government programs and policies; national and international political and economic events,
changes in interest rates, inflation and deflation and changes in supply and demand relationships. Trading derivative instruments involves
risks different from, or possibly greater than, the risks associated with investing directly in securities. Derivative contracts ordinarily
have leverage inherent in their terms. The use of leverage may cause the Fund to liquidate portfolio positions when it would not be advantageous
to do so in order to satisfy its obligations or to meet regulatory or contractual requirements for derivatives. The use of derivatives
can magnify potential for gain or loss and, therefore, amplify the effects of market volatility on share price.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in"><B>DISTRIBUTION TAX RISK</B>.
The Fund currently expects to make distributions on a weekly basis. These distributions may exceed the Fund&rsquo;s income and gains for
the Fund&rsquo;s taxable year. Distributions in excess of the Fund&rsquo;s current and accumulated earnings and profits will be treated
as a return of capital. A return of capital distribution generally will not be taxable but will reduce the shareholder&rsquo;s cost basis
and will result in a higher capital gain or lower capital loss when those Fund Shares on which the distribution was received are sold.
Once a Fund shareholder&rsquo;s cost basis is reduced to zero, further distributions will be treated as capital gain if the Fund shareholder
holds Fund Shares as capital assets. Additionally, any capital returned through distributions will be distributed after payment of Fund
fees and expenses. Because a portion of the Fund&rsquo;s distributions may consist of return of capital, the Fund may not be an appropriate
investment for investors who do not want their principal investment in the Fund to decrease over time or who do not wish to receive return
of capital in a given period. In the event that a shareholder purchases Fund Shares shortly before a distribution by the Fund, the entire
distribution may be taxable to the shareholder even though a portion of the distribution effectively represents a return of the purchase
price.</P>

an ETF held by the Fund will fluctuate over time based on fluctuations in the values of the assets held by the ETF, which may be affected
by changes in general economic conditions, expectations for future growth and profits, interest rates and the supply and demand for those
assets. When the Fund invests in an ETF, it will bear a proportionate share of the ETF&rsquo;s expenses. In addition, ETFs are subject
to Active Market Risk, Operational Risk, Premium/Discount Risk and the Structural ETF Risks set forth below. Brokerage, tax and other
expenses may negatively impact the performance of the ETF and, in turn, the value of Fund Shares.</P>

FLEX Options involves risks different from, or possibly greater than, the risks associated with investing directly in securities. The
Fund may experience losses from specific FLEX Option positions and certain FLEX Option positions may expire worthless. The FLEX Options
are listed on an exchange; however, no one can guarantee that a liquid secondary trading market will exist for the FLEX Options. In the
event that trading in the FLEX Options is limited or absent, the value of the Fund&rsquo;s FLEX Options may decrease. In a less liquid
market for the FLEX Options, liquidating the FLEX Options may require the payment of a premium (for written FLEX Options) or acceptance
of a discounted price (for purchased FLEX Options) and may take longer to complete. A less liquid trading market may adversely impact
the value of the FLEX Options and Fund Shares and result in the Fund being unable to achieve its investment objective. Less liquidity
in the trading of the Fund&rsquo;s FLEX Options could have an impact on the prices paid or received by the Fund for the FLEX Options in
connection with creations and redemptions of the Fund&rsquo;s shares. Depending on the nature of this impact to pricing, the Fund may
be forced to pay more for redemptions (or receive less for creations) than the price at which it currently values the FLEX Options. Such
overpayment or under collection could reduce the Fund&rsquo;s ability to achieve its investment objective. Additionally, in a less liquid
market for the FLEX Options, the liquidation of a large number of options may more significantly impact the price. A less liquid trading
market may adversely impact the value of the FLEX Options and the value of your investment. The trading in FLEX Options may be less deep
and liquid than the market for certain other exchange-traded options, non-customized options or other securities.</P>

Inflation risk is the risk that the value of assets or income from investments will be less in the future as inflation decreases the value
of money. As inflation increases, the present value of the Fund&rsquo;s assets and distributions may decline. This risk is more prevalent
with respect to fixed income securities held by the Fund.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in"><B>INTEREST RATE RISK</B><I>.</I>
Interest rate risk is the risk that the value of the debt securities in the Fund&rsquo;s portfolio will decline because of rising market
interest rates. Interest rate risk is generally lower for shorter term debt securities and higher for longer-term debt securities. Duration
is a reasonably accurate measure of a debt security&rsquo;s price sensitivity to changes in interest rates and a common measure of interest
rate risk. Duration measures a debt security&rsquo;s expected life on a present value basis, taking into account the debt security&rsquo;s
yield, interest payments and final maturity. In general, duration represents the expected percentage change in the value of a security
for an immediate 1% change in interest rates. For example, the price of a debt security with a three-year duration would be expected to
drop by approximately 3% in response to a 1% increase in interest rates. Therefore, prices of debt securities with shorter durations tend
to be less sensitive to interest rate changes than debt securities with longer durations. As the value of a debt security changes over
time, so will its duration.</P>

the Fund does not seek leveraged exposure to the Bitcoin ETFs, the Fund seeks to achieve and maintain the exposure to the price of the
Bitcoin ETFs by using the leverage inherent in options contracts. Therefore, the Fund is subject to leverage risk. When the Fund purchases
or sells an instrument or enters into a transaction without investing an amount equal to the full economic exposure of the instrument
or transaction, it creates leverage, which can result in the Fund losing more than it originally invested. As a result, these investments
may magnify losses to the Fund, and even a small market movement may result in significant losses to the Fund. Leverage may also cause
the Fund to be more volatile because it may exaggerate the effect of any increase or decrease in the value of the Fund&rsquo;s portfolio
securities. Options trading involves a degree of leverage and as a result, a relatively small price movement in futures instruments may
result in immediate and substantial losses to the Fund.</P>

The Fund may hold certain options that do not qualify as &ldquo;Section 1256 contracts&rdquo; under Section 1256 of the Code, and disposition
of such options will likely result in short-term or long-term capital gains or losses depending on the holding period. In addition, based
upon language in the legislative history, the Fund intends to treat the issuer of the options as the issuer of the referenced asset or
in the case of Bitcoin ETF Options that reference a Bitcoin ETF Index, the issuers of the securities underlying the index, which, assuming
the referenced asset qualifies as a RIC, would allow the Fund to qualify for special rules in the RIC diversification requirements. If
the income is not qualifying income or the issuer of the options is not appropriately the referenced asset or the issuers of the securities
underlying the index, the Fund could lose its own status as a RIC.</P>

of the RIC qualification rules under Subchapter M of the Code. It has adopted this position in reliance on an opinion obtained from counsel
that income from such investments should constitute &ldquo;qualifying income,&rdquo; as the Bitcoin ETFs and Bitcoin ETF Indexes referenced
by the options constitute &ldquo;securities&rdquo; under Section 2(a)(36) of the 1940 Act. However, this opinion is not binding upon the
Internal Revenue Service (&ldquo;IRS&rdquo;). If the IRS were to successfully assert that the Fund&rsquo;s income from such investments
was not &ldquo;qualifying income,&rdquo; the Fund may fail to qualify as a RIC under Subchapter M if over 10% of its gross income was
derived from these investments. If the Fund failed to qualify as a RIC, it would be subject to federal and state income tax on all of
its taxable income at regular corporate tax rates with no deduction for any distributions paid to shareholders, which would significantly

RIC, the Fund must distribute 90% of its investment company taxable income annually. In addition, to avoid a non-deductible excise tax,
the Fund must distribute 98% of its ordinary income and 98.2% of its capital gain net income. Separately, depending upon the circumstances,
sales to fund redemptions could cause the Fund to recognize income that the Fund is required to distribute to maintain the Fund&rsquo;s
RIC status and avoid the excise tax. Funding such distributions could require additional sales, which could require more distributions
and affect the projected performance of the Fund. Alternatively, if the Fund only makes distributions to maintain its RIC status and becomes
subject to the excise tax, that could also affect the projected performance of the Fund. In either case, the assets sold to fund redemptions,
distributions or pay the excise tax will not be available to assist the Fund in meeting its investment objective.</P>

Risk</U></I>. The Fund currently expects to effect a significant portion of its creations and redemptions for cash, rather than in-kind
securities. Paying redemption proceeds in cash rather than through in-kind delivery of portfolio securities may require the Fund to dispose
of or sell portfolio securities or other assets at an inopportune time to obtain the cash needed to meet redemption orders. This may cause
the Fund to sell a security and recognize a capital gain or loss that might not have been incurred if it had made a redemption in-kind.
As a result, the Fund may pay out higher or lower annual capital gains distributions than ETFs that redeem in-kind. The use of cash creations
and redemptions may also cause the Fund&rsquo;s Shares to trade in the market at greater bid-ask spreads or greater premiums or discounts
to the Fund&rsquo;s NAV. Furthermore, the Fund may not be able to execute cash transactions for creation and redemption purposes at the
same price used to determine the Fund&rsquo;s NAV. To the extent that the maximum additional charge for creation or redemption transactions

Authorized Participants is obligated to engage in creation and/or redemption transactions. The Fund has a limited number of institutions
that may act as Authorized Participants on an agency basis (<I>i.e.</I>, on behalf of other market participants). To the extent that Authorized
Participants exit the business or are unable to proceed with creation or redemption orders with respect to the Fund and no other Authorized
Participant is able to step forward to create or redeem, Fund Shares may be more likely to trade at a premium or discount to NAV and possibly
face trading halts or delisting. The Fund may also rely on a small number of third-party market makers to provide a market for the purchase
and sale of Fund Shares but such market makers are under no obligation to do so. Decisions by Authorized Participants or market makers
to reduce their role or step away from these activities in times of market stress could inhibit the effectiveness of the arbitrage process
in maintaining the relationship between the underlying values of the Fund&rsquo;s portfolio securities and the Fund&rsquo;s market price.
Any trading halt or other problem relating to the trading activity of these market makers or any issues disrupting the Authorized Participants&rsquo;
ability to proceed with creation and/or redemption orders could result in a dramatic change in the spread between the Fund&rsquo;s net
asset value and the price at which Fund Shares are trading on the Exchange, which could result in a decrease in value of Fund Shares.
This reduced effectiveness could result in Fund Shares trading at a premium or discount to net asset value and also in greater than normal

have performance history for a full calendar year, no performance information is presented for the Fund at this time. Once the Fund has
completed a full calendar year of investment operations, this section will provide some indication of the risks of investing in the Fund
by showing how the Fund&rsquo;s average annual returns compare with a broad measure of market performance. Past performance does not necessarily
indicate how the Fund will perform in the future. Updated performance information is available at no cost on the Fund&rsquo;s website

Fund Shares to certain institutional investors (typically market makers or other broker-dealers) only in large blocks of Fund Shares known
as &ldquo;Creation Units.&rdquo; Creation Unit transactions are conducted in exchange for the deposit or delivery of a designated portfolio
of in-kind securities and/or cash.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in">Individual Fund Shares may only
be purchased and sold on the Exchange, other national securities exchanges, electronic crossing networks and other alternative trading
systems through your broker-dealer at market prices. Because Fund Shares trade at market prices rather than at net asset value (&ldquo;NAV&rdquo;),
Fund Shares may trade at a price greater than NAV (premium) or less than NAV (discount). When buying or selling Fund Shares in the secondary
market, you may incur costs attributable to the difference between the highest price a buyer is willing to pay to purchase Fund Shares
(bid) and the lowest price a seller is willing to accept for Fund Shares (ask) (the &ldquo;bid-ask spread&rdquo;). Recent information
regarding the Fund&rsquo;s NAV, market price, premiums and discounts, and bid-ask spreads is available at https://www.roundhillinvestments.com/etf/ybtc.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in">To the extent the Fund&rsquo;s
distributions are taxed, they are expected to be taxed as ordinary income and/or capital gains, unless you are investing through a tax-advantaged
arrangement, such as a 401(k) plan or individual retirement account. Any withdrawals made from such tax-advantaged arrangement may be
taxable to you. Certain Fund distributions may exceed the Fund&rsquo;s income and gains for the Fund&rsquo;s taxable year. Distributions
in excess of the Fund&rsquo;s current and accumulated earnings and profits will be treated as a return of capital. A return of capital
distribution generally will not be taxable but will reduce the shareholder&rsquo;s cost basis and will result in a higher capital gain
or lower capital loss when those Fund Shares on which the distribution was received are sold. Once a Fund shareholder&rsquo;s cost basis
is reduced to zero, further distributions will be treated as capital gain if the Fund shareholder holds Fund Shares as capital assets.</P>

through a broker-dealer or other financial intermediary (such as a bank), the Adviser, the Sub-Adviser, the Fund&rsquo;s distributor,
may pay the intermediary for the sale of Fund Shares and related services. These payments may create a conflict of interest by influencing
the broker-dealer or other intermediary and your salesperson to recommend the Fund over another investment. Ask your salesperson or visit
your financial intermediary&rsquo;s website for more information.</P>
