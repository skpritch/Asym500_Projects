<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">The Fund is an actively managed exchange-traded
fund (ETF) that seeks current income while managing risk. As a &ldquo;fund of funds,&rdquo; it invests its assets in shares of
other ETFs and, to a limited extent, exchange traded products (&ldquo;ETPs&rdquo;). The Fund primarily invests in affiliated ETFs
managed by Tidal Investments LLC (the &ldquo;Adviser&rdquo;), but it may also invest in unaffiliated ETFs and ETPs (collectively,
&ldquo;Underlying ETFs&rdquo;). The Fund will not invest in ETFs that are also structured as fund-of-funds or in ETFs that invest
more than 10 percent of their assets in other investment companies and private funds.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">The Fund seeks to allocate capital among
multiple asset classes based on each asset class&rsquo;s expected contribution to overall portfolio risk, rather than on capital
weighting alone. While capital weighting assigns investment amounts by dollar value, a risk-based approach considers how much each
asset class contributes to the Fund&rsquo;s total portfolio risk. This methodology is intended to promote a more balanced risk
profile by limiting the extent to which any single asset class drives overall portfolio volatility. The Fund seeks to combine this
risk-based allocation approach with a target annual distribution rate of 20% to 30%. The Fund&rsquo;s strategy is designed to provide
a high level of sustainable income while maintaining a balanced mix of investments, adjusted for risk, intended to limit volatility.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify"><B>Target Distribution Rate:</B> The Fund
seeks to distribute income at a gross annualized rate of 20% to 30%, paid monthly. <B>This distribution rate is a target only and

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify"><B>Risk Management</B>: As part of its
strategy, the Fund uses a volatility-controlled approach to adjust its exposures among asset classes. This means emphasizing asset
classes that contribute less to portfolio volatility (e.g., such as bonds) and scaling back exposure to those that contribute more
volatility (e.g., stocks). The goal is to help maintain a more stable risk profile across changing market conditions.</P>

ETFs. The asset class exposures are categorized into the following primary groups, each with a target allocation range under normal

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify"><B>Asset Allocation Fund of Funds Risk:</B>
Asset allocation decisions, techniques, analyses, or models implemented by the Adviser may not produce the expected returns, may
cause the Fund&rsquo;s shares to lose value or may cause the Fund to underperform other funds with similar investment goals. Although
the theory behind asset allocation is that diversification among asset classes can help reduce volatility over the long term, the
Adviser&rsquo;s assumptions about asset classes and the Underlying ETFs may diverge from historical performance and assumptions
used to develop allocations in light of actual market conditions. There is a risk that you could achieve better returns by investing
in an individual fund or funds representing a single broad asset class rather than investing in a fund of funds. The Fund&rsquo;s
performance is also closely related to the Underlying ETFs&rsquo; performance and ability to meet their investment goals. Fund
shareholders bear indirectly the expenses of the Underlying ETFs in which the Fund invests in addition to the Fund&rsquo;s management
fee so there is a risk of an additional layer or layers of fees. The Fund&rsquo;s actual asset class allocations may deviate from
the intended allocation because an Underlying ETF&rsquo;s investments can change due to market movements, the Underlying ETF&rsquo;s
investment adviser&rsquo;s investment decisions or other factors, which could result in the fund&rsquo;s risk/&#8203;return target
not being met. As a fund of funds, the Fund is exposed to the same risks as the Underlying ETFs in proportion to the Fund&rsquo;s
allocation to those Underlying ETFs.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify"><B>Affiliated Fund of Funds Structure Risks.</B>
The Adviser does not typically consider unaffiliated ETFs as investment options for the Fund. The Adviser is subject to competing
interests that have the potential to influence its investment decisions for the Fund. For example, the Adviser may have an incentive
to select an Underlying ETF that generates higher profitability for the Adviser over another Underlying ETF. In addition, the Adviser
may be influenced by its view of the best interests of Underlying ETFs, such as a view that an Underlying ETF may benefit from
additional assets or could be harmed by redemptions.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify"><B>Asset Class Correlation Risk</B>. The
Fund relies on a risk-based allocation strategy that assumes imperfect correlation among asset classes to manage volatility. However,
in periods of market stress or dislocation, asset classes that typically behave differently may begin to move together, reducing
the effectiveness of diversification. Increased correlations among Underlying ETFs may amplify losses and reduce the Fund&rsquo;s
ability to manage risk effectively.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify"><B>Underlying ETF Risks. </B>The Fund will
invest its assets in the Underlying ETFs, so the Fund&rsquo;s investment performance will be directly related to the performance
of the Underlying ETFs. The Fund&rsquo;s NAV will change with changes in the value of the Underlying ETFs in which it invests.
An investment in the Fund may entail more costs and expenses than the combined costs and expenses of direct investments in the
Underlying ETFs. The Fund is exposed to the risks associated with investments in the following types of Underlying ETFs. In addition,
each Underlying ETF is subject to &ldquo;ETF Risks&rdquo; described below.</P>

These Underlying ETFs are subject to interest rate, credit, prepayment, and liquidity risks. Interest rate risk is the potential decline in bond prices due to rising rates. Credit risk involves issuers possibly defaulting on payments. Prepayment risk happens when issuers repay earlier than expected, reducing returns. Liquidity risk occurs if ETFs hold hard-to-sell bonds, especially during market turmoil. Using derivatives for hedging or investment purposes introduces counterparty and leverage risks, amplifying potential losses. Performance depends heavily on interest rates and the creditworthiness of issuers.</TD></TR>

exposure to real estate investment trusts (&ldquo;REITs&rdquo;), income-producing properties, and infrastructure-related assets.
These Underlying ETFs are subject to real estate market risk, interest rate risk, sector concentration risk, and management risk.
Real estate market risk involves declines in property values, rental income, or occupancy rates, which can negatively impact the
performance of REITs or real estate-related securities. Interest rate risk may cause REIT and infrastructure asset prices to decline
when interest rates rise, as higher yields on other investments may make them more attractive. Sector concentration risk arises
when an Underlying ETF invests heavily in real estate or infrastructure sectors, increasing volatility from adverse developments
specific to those sectors. Infrastructure assets may be exposed to regulatory, political, environmental, and operational risks,
particularly for assets tied to utilities, transportation, or energy systems. Additionally, these Underlying ETFs may use leverage,
which can amplify losses during market downturns. Performance depends on the value and income potential of the underlying real
estate or infrastructure holdings and the success of the managers&rsquo; investment strategies.</TD></TR></TABLE>

or conditions in one country or region will adversely impact markets or issuers in other countries or regions. Securities in the
Fund&rsquo;s portfolio may underperform in comparison to securities in the general financial markets, a particular financial market,
or other asset classes, due to a number of factors, including inflation (or expectations for inflation), deflation (or expectations
for deflation), interest rates, global demand for particular products or resources, market instability, financial system instability,
debt crises and downgrades, embargoes, tariffs, sanctions and other trade barriers, regulatory events, other governmental trade
or market control programs and related geopolitical events. In addition, the value of the Fund&rsquo;s investments may be negatively
affected by the occurrence of global events such as war, terrorism, environmental disasters, natural disasters or events, country
instability, and infectious disease epidemics or pandemics.&nbsp; The imposition by the U.S. of&nbsp;tariffs&nbsp;on goods imported
from foreign countries and reciprocal&nbsp;tariffs&nbsp;levied on U.S. goods by those countries also may lead to volatility and

Shares.</I> Investors buying or selling Shares in the secondary market will pay brokerage commissions or other charges imposed
by brokers, as determined by that broker. Brokerage commissions are often a fixed amount and may be a significant proportional
cost for investors seeking to buy or sell relatively small amounts of Shares. In addition, secondary market investors will also
incur the cost of the bid-ask spread. The bid-ask spread varies over time for Shares based on trading volume and market liquidity.
The bid-ask spread is generally smaller if Shares have more trading volume and market liquidity and larger if Shares have little
trading volume and market liquidity. Further, a relatively small investor base in the Fund, asset swings in the Fund and/or increased
market volatility may increase the bid-ask spread. &nbsp;Due to the costs of buying or selling Shares, including brokerage commissions
imposed by brokers and bid-ask spreads, frequent trading of Shares may significantly reduce investment results and an investment
in Shares may not be advisable for investors who anticipate regularly making small investments.</P>

that the market price of Shares will approximate the Fund&rsquo;s NAV, there may be times when the market price of Shares is more
than the NAV intra-day (premium) or less than the NAV intra-day (discount) due to supply and demand of Shares or during periods
of market volatility. This risk is heightened in times of market volatility, periods of steep market declines, and periods when
there is limited trading activity for Shares in the secondary market, in which case such premiums or discounts may be significant.</P>

that the Shares will trade with any volume, or at all, on any stock exchange. In stressed market conditions, the liquidity of Shares
may begin to mirror the liquidity of the Fund&rsquo;s underlying portfolio holdings, which can be significantly less liquid than
Shares. Shares trade on the Exchange at a market price that may be below, at or above the Fund&rsquo;s NAV. Trading in Shares on
the Exchange may be halted due to market conditions or for reasons that, in the view of the Exchange, make trading in Shares inadvisable.
In addition, trading in Shares on the Exchange is subject to trading halts caused by extraordinary market volatility pursuant to
the Exchange &ldquo;circuit breaker&rdquo; rules. There can be no assurance that the requirements of the Exchange necessary to

cause the automatic termination of services with Board approval, but without shareholder approval. Shareholders will be notified
of any sub-adviser changes. The Adviser has the ultimate responsibility, subject to oversight by the Board, to oversee a sub-adviser

skill in managing the Underlying ETFs. Poor investment decisions or unsuccessful strategies in any regime can significantly impact
the Fund&rsquo;s performance. As a result, management risk is a principal risk at the Fund level.</TD>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify"><B>Affiliated Fund of Funds Structure Risks.</B>
The Adviser does not typically consider unaffiliated ETFs as investment options for the Fund. The Adviser is subject to competing
interests that have the potential to influence its investment decisions for the Fund. For example, the Adviser may have an incentive
to select an Underlying ETF that generates higher profitability for the Adviser over another Underlying ETF. In addition, the Adviser
may be influenced by its view of the best interests of Underlying ETFs, such as a view that an Underlying ETF may benefit from
additional assets or could be harmed by redemptions.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify"><B>Asset Allocation Fund of Funds Risk:</B>
Asset allocation decisions, techniques, analyses, or models implemented by the Adviser may not produce the expected returns, may
cause the Fund&rsquo;s shares to lose value or may cause the Fund to underperform other funds with similar investment goals. Although
the theory behind asset allocation is that diversification among asset classes can help reduce volatility over the long term, the
Adviser&rsquo;s assumptions about asset classes and the Underlying ETFs may diverge from historical performance and assumptions
used to develop allocations in light of actual market conditions. There is a risk that you could achieve better returns by investing
in an individual fund or funds representing a single broad asset class rather than investing in a fund of funds. The Fund&rsquo;s
performance is also closely related to the Underlying ETFs&rsquo; performance and ability to meet their investment goals. Fund
shareholders bear indirectly the expenses of the Underlying ETFs in which the Fund invests in addition to the Fund&rsquo;s management
fee so there is a risk of an additional layer or layers of fees. The Fund&rsquo;s actual asset class allocations may deviate from
the intended allocation because an Underlying ETF&rsquo;s investments can change due to market movements, the Underlying ETF&rsquo;s
investment adviser&rsquo;s investment decisions or other factors, which could result in the fund&rsquo;s risk/&#8203;return target
not being met. As a fund of funds, the Fund is exposed to the same risks as the Underlying ETFs in proportion to the Fund&rsquo;s
allocation to those Underlying ETFs.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify"><B>Asset Class Correlation Risk</B>. The
Fund relies on a risk-based allocation strategy that assumes imperfect correlation among asset classes to manage volatility. However,
in periods of market stress or dislocation, asset classes that typically behave differently may begin to move together, reducing
the effectiveness of diversification. Increased correlations among Underlying ETFs may amplify losses and reduce the Fund&rsquo;s
ability to manage risk effectively.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify"><B>Economic and Market Risk.</B> Economies
and financial markets throughout the world are becoming increasingly interconnected, which increases the likelihood that events
or conditions in one country or region will adversely impact markets or issuers in other countries or regions. Securities in the
Fund&rsquo;s portfolio may underperform in comparison to securities in the general financial markets, a particular financial market,
or other asset classes, due to a number of factors, including inflation (or expectations for inflation), deflation (or expectations
for deflation), interest rates, global demand for particular products or resources, market instability, financial system instability,
debt crises and downgrades, embargoes, tariffs, sanctions and other trade barriers, regulatory events, other governmental trade
or market control programs and related geopolitical events. In addition, the value of the Fund&rsquo;s investments may be negatively
affected by the occurrence of global events such as war, terrorism, environmental disasters, natural disasters or events, country
instability, and infectious disease epidemics or pandemics.&nbsp; The imposition by the U.S. of&nbsp;tariffs&nbsp;on goods imported
from foreign countries and reciprocal&nbsp;tariffs&nbsp;levied on U.S. goods by those countries also may lead to volatility and
instability in domestic and foreign markets.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0 0pt 0.5in; text-align: justify"><I>Authorized Participants, Market
Makers, and Liquidity Providers Concentration Risk.</I> The Fund has a limited number of financial institutions that are authorized
to purchase and redeem Shares directly from the Fund (known as &ldquo;Authorized Participants&rdquo; or &ldquo;APs&rdquo;). In
addition, there may be a limited number of market makers and/or liquidity providers in the marketplace. To the extent either of
the following events occur, Shares may trade at a material discount to NAV and possibly face delisting: (i) APs exit the business
or otherwise become unable to process creation and/or redemption orders and no other APs step forward to perform these services;
or (ii) market makers and/or liquidity providers exit the business or significantly reduce their business activities and no other
entities step forward to perform their functions.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0 0pt 0.5in; text-align: justify"><I>Costs of Buying or Selling
Shares.</I> Investors buying or selling Shares in the secondary market will pay brokerage commissions or other charges imposed
by brokers, as determined by that broker. Brokerage commissions are often a fixed amount and may be a significant proportional
cost for investors seeking to buy or sell relatively small amounts of Shares. In addition, secondary market investors will also
incur the cost of the bid-ask spread. The bid-ask spread varies over time for Shares based on trading volume and market liquidity.
The bid-ask spread is generally smaller if Shares have more trading volume and market liquidity and larger if Shares have little
trading volume and market liquidity. Further, a relatively small investor base in the Fund, asset swings in the Fund and/or increased
market volatility may increase the bid-ask spread. &nbsp;Due to the costs of buying or selling Shares, including brokerage commissions
imposed by brokers and bid-ask spreads, frequent trading of Shares may significantly reduce investment results and an investment
in Shares may not be advisable for investors who anticipate regularly making small investments.</P>

Other Than NAV.</I> As with all ETFs, Shares may be bought and sold in the secondary market at market prices. Although it is expected
that the market price of Shares will approximate the Fund&rsquo;s NAV, there may be times when the market price of Shares is more
than the NAV intra-day (premium) or less than the NAV intra-day (discount) due to supply and demand of Shares or during periods
of market volatility. This risk is heightened in times of market volatility, periods of steep market declines, and periods when
there is limited trading activity for Shares in the secondary market, in which case such premiums or discounts may be significant.</P>

are listed on a national securities exchange, such as NYSE Arca, Inc. (the &ldquo;Exchange&rdquo;), and may be traded on U.S. exchanges
other than the Exchange, there can be no assurance that an active trading market for the Shares will develop or be maintained or
that the Shares will trade with any volume, or at all, on any stock exchange. In stressed market conditions, the liquidity of Shares
may begin to mirror the liquidity of the Fund&rsquo;s underlying portfolio holdings, which can be significantly less liquid than
Shares. Shares trade on the Exchange at a market price that may be below, at or above the Fund&rsquo;s NAV. Trading in Shares on
the Exchange may be halted due to market conditions or for reasons that, in the view of the Exchange, make trading in Shares inadvisable.
In addition, trading in Shares on the Exchange is subject to trading halts caused by extraordinary market volatility pursuant to
the Exchange &ldquo;circuit breaker&rdquo; rules. There can be no assurance that the requirements of the Exchange necessary to
maintain the listing of the Fund will continue to be met or will remain unchanged.</P>

These Underlying ETFs are subject to real estate market risk, interest rate risk, sector concentration risk, and management risk.
Real estate market risk involves declines in property values, rental income, or occupancy rates, which can negatively impact the
performance of REITs or real estate-related securities. Interest rate risk may cause REIT and infrastructure asset prices to decline
when interest rates rise, as higher yields on other investments may make them more attractive. Sector concentration risk arises
when an Underlying ETF invests heavily in real estate or infrastructure sectors, increasing volatility from adverse developments
specific to those sectors. Infrastructure assets may be exposed to regulatory, political, environmental, and operational risks,
particularly for assets tied to utilities, transportation, or energy systems. Additionally, these Underlying ETFs may use leverage,
which can amplify losses during market downturns. Performance depends on the value and income potential of the underlying real

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">The Fund issues and redeems Shares only
in Creation Units at the NAV per share next determined after receipt of an order from an AP. Only APs may acquire Shares directly
from the Fund, and only APs may tender their Shares for redemption directly to the Fund, at NAV. APs must be a member or participant
of a clearing agency registered with the SEC and must execute a Participant Agreement that has been agreed to by the Distributor
(defined below), and that has been accepted by the Fund&rsquo;s transfer agent, with respect to purchases and redemptions of Creation
Units. Once created, Shares trade in the secondary market in quantities less than a Creation Unit.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">In order to purchase Creation Units of
the Fund, an AP must generally deposit a designated portfolio of equity securities (the &ldquo;Deposit Securities&rdquo;) and/or
a designated amount of U.S. cash. Purchases and redemptions of Creation Units primarily with cash, rather than through in-kind
delivery of portfolio securities, may cause the Fund to incur certain costs. These costs could include brokerage costs or taxable
gains or losses that it might not have incurred if it had made redemption in-kind. These costs could be imposed on the Fund, and
thus decrease the Fund&rsquo;s NAV, to the extent that the costs are not offset by a transaction fee payable by an AP.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">Most investors buy and sell Shares in secondary

broker, you will incur customary brokerage commissions and charges, and you may pay some or all of the spread between the bid and
the offer price in the secondary market on each leg of a round trip (purchase and sale) transaction. In addition, because secondary
market transactions occur at market prices, you may pay more than NAV when you buy Shares, and receive less than NAV when you sell
those Shares.</P>

participants include securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, clearing corporations and other institutions that
directly or indirectly maintain a custodial relationship with DTC. As a beneficial owner of Shares, you are not entitled to receive
physical delivery of stock certificates or to have Shares registered in your name, and you are not considered a registered owner
of Shares. Therefore, to exercise any right as an owner of Shares, you must rely upon the procedures of DTC and its participants.
These procedures are the same as those that apply to any other securities that you hold in book-entry or street name through your
brokerage account.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">The Fund imposes no restrictions on the
frequency of purchases and redemptions of Shares. In determining not to approve a written, established policy, the Board evaluated
the risks of market timing activities by Fund shareholders. Purchases and redemptions by APs, who are the only parties that may
purchase or redeem Shares directly with the Fund, are an essential part of the ETF process and help keep Share trading prices in
line with the NAV. As such, the Fund accommodates frequent purchases and redemptions by APs. However, the Board has also determined
that frequent purchases and redemptions for cash may increase tracking error and portfolio transaction costs and may lead to the
realization of capital gains. To minimize these potential consequences of frequent purchases and redemptions, the Fund employs
fair value pricing and may impose transaction fees on purchases and redemptions of Creation Units to cover the custodial and other
costs incurred by the Fund in effecting trades. In addition, the Fund and the Adviser reserve the right to reject any purchase
order at any time.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">The Board has designated the Adviser as
the &ldquo;valuation designee&rdquo; for the Fund under Rule 2a-5 of the 1940 Act, subject to its oversight. The Adviser has adopted
procedures and methodologies, which have been approved by the Board, to fair value Fund investments whose market prices are not
readily available or are deemed to be unreliable. For example, such circumstances may arise when: (i) an investment has been delisted
or has had its trading halted or suspended; (ii) an investment&rsquo;s primary pricing source is unable or unwilling to provide
a price; (iii) an investment&rsquo;s primary trading market is closed during regular market hours; or (iv) an investment&rsquo;s
value is materially affected by events occurring after the close of the investment&rsquo;s primary trading market. Generally, when
fair valuing an investment, the Adviser will take into account all reasonably available information that may be relevant to a particular
valuation including, but not limited to, fundamental analytical data regarding the issuer, information relating to the issuer&rsquo;s
business, recent trades or offers of the investment, general and/or specific market conditions, and the specific facts giving rise
to the need to fair value the investment. Fair value determinations are made in good faith and in accordance with the fair value
methodologies included in the Adviser adopted valuation procedures. The Adviser will fair value Fund investments whose market prices
are not &ldquo;readily available&rdquo; or are deemed to be unreliable. Due to the subjective and variable nature of fair value
pricing, there can be no assurance that the Adviser will be able to obtain the fair value assigned to the investment upon the sale
of such investment.</P>

treatment as a regulated investment company (a &ldquo;RIC&rdquo;) under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the &ldquo;Code&rdquo;).
If it meets certain minimum distribution requirements, a RIC is not subject to tax at the fund-level on income and gains from investments
that are timely distributed to shareholders. However, the Fund&rsquo;s failure to qualify as a RIC or to meet minimum distribution
requirements would result (if certain relief provisions were not available) in fund-level taxation and, consequently, a reduction
in income available for distribution to shareholders.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">For federal income tax purposes, distributions
of net investment income are generally taxable to shareholders as ordinary income or qualified dividend income. Taxes on distributions
of net capital gains (if any) are determined by how long the Fund owned the investments that generated them, rather than how long
a shareholder has owned their Shares. Sales of assets held by the Fund for more than one year generally result in long-term capital
gains and losses, and sales of assets held by the Fund for one year or less generally result in short-term capital gains and losses.
Distributions of the Fund&rsquo;s net capital gain (the excess of net long-term capital gains over net short-term capital losses)
that are reported by the Fund as capital gain dividends (&ldquo;Capital Gain Dividends&rdquo;) will be taxable as long-term capital
gains to shareholders. Distributions of short-term capital gain will generally be taxable to shareholders as ordinary income. Dividends
and distributions are generally taxable to you whether you receive them in cash or reinvest them in additional Shares.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">Distributions reported by the Fund as &ldquo;qualified
dividend income&rdquo; are generally taxed to non-corporate shareholders at rates applicable to long-term capital gains, provided
certain holding period and other requirements are met. &ldquo;Qualified dividend income&rdquo; generally is income derived from
dividends paid by U.S. corporations or certain foreign corporations that are either incorporated in a U.S. possession or eligible
for tax benefits under certain U.S. income tax treaties. In addition, dividends that the Fund receives in respect of stock of certain
foreign corporations may be qualified dividend income if that stock is readily tradable on an established U.S. securities market.
Corporate shareholders may be entitled to a dividends-received deduction for the portion of dividends they receive from the Fund
that are attributable to dividends received by the Fund from U.S. corporations, subject to certain limitations.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">Shortly after the close of each calendar
year, you will be informed of the character of any distributions received from the Fund.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">In addition to the federal income tax,
certain individuals, trusts, and estates may be subject to a Net Investment Income (&ldquo;NII&rdquo;) tax of 3.8%. The NII tax
is imposed on the lesser of: (i) a taxpayer&rsquo;s investment income, net of deductions properly allocable to such income; or
(ii) the amount by which such taxpayer&rsquo;s modified adjusted gross income exceeds certain thresholds ($250,000 for married
individuals filing jointly, $200,000 for unmarried individuals and $125,000 for married individuals filing separately). The Fund&rsquo;s
distributions are includable in a shareholder&rsquo;s investment income for purposes of this NII tax. In addition, any capital
gain realized by a shareholder upon a sale or redemption of Fund shares is includable in such shareholder&rsquo;s investment income
for purposes of this NII tax.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">In general, your distributions are subject
to federal income tax for the year in which they are paid. Certain distributions paid in January, however, may be treated as paid
on December 31 of the prior year. Distributions are generally taxable to you even if they are paid from income or gains earned
by the Fund before your investment (and thus were included in the Shares&rsquo; NAV when you purchased your Shares).</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">You may wish to avoid investing in the
Fund shortly before a dividend or other distribution, because such a distribution will generally be taxable to you even though
it may economically represent a return of a portion of your investment.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">If you are neither a resident nor a citizen
of the United States or if you are a foreign entity, distributions (other than Capital Gain Dividends) paid to you by the Fund
will generally be subject to a U.S. withholding tax at the rate of 30%, unless a lower treaty rate applies. The Fund may, under
certain circumstances, report all or a portion of a dividend as an &ldquo;interest-related dividend&rdquo; or a &ldquo;short-term
capital gain dividend&rdquo;, which would generally be exempt from this 30% U.S. withholding tax, provided certain other requirements
are met.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">Under the Foreign Account Tax Compliance
Act (&ldquo;FATCA&rdquo;), the Fund may be required to withhold a generally nonrefundable 30% tax on distributions of net investment
income paid to (A) certain &ldquo;foreign financial institutions&rdquo; unless such foreign financial institution agrees to verify,
monitor, and report to the Internal Revenue Service (&ldquo;IRS&rdquo;) the identity of certain of its account-holders, among other
items (or unless such entity is otherwise deemed compliant under the terms of an intergovernmental agreement between the United
States and the foreign financial institution&rsquo;s country of residence), and (B) certain &ldquo;non-financial foreign entities&rdquo;
unless such entity certifies to the Fund that it does not have any substantial U.S. owners or provides the name, address, and taxpayer
identification number of each substantial U.S. owner, among other items. This FATCA withholding tax could also affect the Fund&rsquo;s
return on its investments in foreign securities or affect a shareholder&rsquo;s return if the shareholder holds its Fund shares
through a foreign intermediary. You are urged to consult your tax adviser regarding the application of this FATCA withholding tax
to your investment in the Fund and the potential certification, compliance, due diligence, reporting, and withholding obligations
to which you may become subject in order to avoid this withholding tax.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">The Fund (or a financial intermediary,
such as a broker, through which a shareholder owns Shares) generally is required to withhold and remit to the U.S. Treasury a percentage

identification number, who has underreported dividend or interest income, or who fails to certify that they are not subject to
such withholding.</P>

a short-term capital gain or loss if Shares have been held for one year or less. However, any capital loss on a sale of Shares
held for six months or less is treated as long-term capital loss to the extent of Capital Gain Dividends paid with respect to such
Shares. Any loss realized on a sale will be disallowed to the extent Shares are acquired, including through reinvestment of dividends,
within a 61-day period beginning 30 days before and ending 30 days after the sale of substantially identical Shares.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">An AP having the U.S. dollar as its functional
currency for U.S. federal income tax purposes who exchanges securities for Creation Units generally recognizes a gain or a loss.
The gain or loss will be equal to the difference between the value of the Creation Units at the time of the exchange and the exchanging
AP&rsquo;s aggregate basis in the securities delivered plus the amount of any cash paid for the Creation Units. An AP who exchanges
Creation Units for securities will generally recognize a gain or loss equal to the difference between the exchanging AP&rsquo;s
basis in the Creation Units and the aggregate U.S. dollar market value of the securities received, plus any cash received for such
Creation Units. The IRS may assert, however, that a loss that is realized upon an exchange of securities for Creation Units may
not be currently deducted under the rules governing &ldquo;wash sales&rdquo; (for an AP who does not mark-to-market their holdings)
or on the basis that there has been no significant change in economic position. Persons exchanging securities should consult their
own tax advisor with respect to whether wash sale rules apply and when a loss might be deductible.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">Any capital gain or loss realized upon
redemption of Creation Units is generally treated as long-term capital gain or loss if Shares comprising the Creation Units have
been held for more than one year and as a short-term capital gain or loss if such Shares have been held for one year or less.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">The Fund may include a payment of cash
in addition to, or in place of, the delivery of a basket of securities upon the redemption of Creation Units. The Fund may sell
portfolio securities to obtain the cash needed to distribute redemption proceeds. This may cause the Fund to recognize investment
income and/or capital gains or losses that it might not have recognized if it had completely satisfied the redemption in-kind.
As a result, the Fund may be less tax efficient if it includes such a cash payment in the proceeds paid upon the redemption of
Creation Units.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">If you are investing through a taxable
account, you should carefully consider the timing of your investment relative to the Fund&rsquo;s distribution schedule. Purchasing
Fund shares shortly before a distribution may increase your tax liability, a situation commonly referred to as &ldquo;buying a
dividend.&rdquo;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">When the Fund makes a distribution, its
share price typically drops by an amount roughly equal to the distribution. As a hypothetical example, if you invest $5,000 to
purchase 250 shares at $20 per share on December 15, and the Fund pays a $1 per share distribution on December 16, the share price
would adjust to $19 (ignoring market fluctuations). Although your total investment value remains $5,000 (250 shares &times; $19
in share value plus 250 shares &times; $1 distribution), you would owe taxes on the $250 distribution, even if you reinvest the
distribution rather than receiving it in cash.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">Distributions are taxable to shareholders
even if they are paid from income or gains realized by the Fund before you invested, and even if they were reflected in the purchase
price of the shares. Consequently, you may incur taxes on income or gains that accrued before your investment, without corresponding
benefit.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">Unless you are investing through a tax-advantaged
account, such as an IRA or an employer-sponsored retirement plan, you may wish to avoid purchasing Fund shares shortly before a

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">The Third Amended and Restated Agreement
and Declaration of Trust (&ldquo;Declaration of Trust&rdquo;) provides a detailed process for the bringing of derivative or direct
actions by shareholders in order to permit legitimate inquiries and claims while avoiding the time, expense, distraction, and other
harm that can be caused to the Fund or its shareholders as a result of spurious shareholder demands and derivative actions. Prior
to bringing a derivative action, a demand by three unrelated shareholders must first be made on the Fund&rsquo;s Trustees. The
Declaration of Trust details various information, certifications, undertakings and acknowledgments that must be included in the
demand. Following receipt of the demand, the trustees have a period of 90 days, which may be extended by an additional 60 days,
to consider the demand. If a majority of the Trustees who are considered independent for the purposes of considering the demand
determine that maintaining the suit would not be in the best interests of the Fund, the Trustees are required to reject the demand
and the complaining shareholders may not proceed with the derivative action unless the shareholders are able to sustain the burden
of proof to a court that the decision of the Trustees not to pursue the requested action was not a good faith exercise of their
business judgment on behalf of the Fund. The Declaration of Trust further provides that shareholders owning Shares representing
no less than a majority of the Fund&rsquo;s outstanding shares must join in bringing the derivative action. If a demand is rejected,
the complaining shareholders will be responsible for the costs and expenses (including attorneys&rsquo; fees) incurred by the Fund
in connection with the consideration of the demand, if a court determines that the demand was made without reasonable cause or
for an improper purpose. If a derivative action is brought in violation of the Declaration of Trust, the shareholders bringing
the action may be responsible for the Fund&rsquo;s costs, including attorneys&rsquo; fees, if a court determines that the action
was brought without reasonable cause or for an improper purpose. The Declaration of Trust provides that no shareholder may bring
a direct action claiming injury as a shareholder of the Trust, or any Fund, where the matters alleged (if true) would give rise
to a claim by the Trust or by the Trust on behalf of the Fund, unless the shareholder has suffered an injury distinct from that
suffered by the shareholders of the Trust, or the Fund, generally. Under the Declaration of Trust, a shareholder bringing a direct
claim must be a shareholder of the Fund with respect to which the direct action is brought at the time of the injury complained
of or have acquired the shares afterwards by operation of law from a person who was a shareholder at that time. The Declaration
of Trust further provides that the Fund shall be responsible for payment of attorneys&rsquo; fees and legal expenses incurred by
a complaining shareholder only if required by law, and any attorneys&rsquo; fees that the Fund is obligated to pay shall be calculated
using reasonable hourly rates. These provisions do not apply to claims brought under the federal securities laws.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">The Declaration of Trust also requires
that actions by shareholders against the Fund be brought exclusively in a federal or state court located within the State of Delaware.
This provision will not apply to claims brought under the federal securities laws. Limiting shareholders&rsquo; ability to bring
actions only in courts located in Delaware may cause shareholders economic hardship to litigate the action in those courts, including
paying for travel expenses of witnesses and counsel, requiring retaining local counsel, and may limit shareholders&rsquo; ability
to bring a claim in a judicial forum that shareholders find favorable for disputes, which may discourage such actions.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">The Trust is an open-end management investment
company consisting of multiple series, including the Fund. This SAI relates to the Smart Allocation<SUP>TM</SUP> High Income ETF
(the &ldquo;Fund&rdquo;). The Trust was organized as a Delaware statutory trust on May 19, 2016. The Trust is registered with the
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (&ldquo;SEC&rdquo;) under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (together with
the rules and regulations adopted thereunder, as amended, the &ldquo;1940 Act&rdquo;), as an open-end management investment company
and the offering of the Fund&rsquo;s shares (&ldquo;Shares&rdquo;) is registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the
&ldquo;Securities Act&rdquo;). The Trust is governed by its Board of Trustees (the &ldquo;Board&rdquo;). Tidal Investments LLC
(the &ldquo;Adviser&rdquo;) serves as investment adviser to the Fund.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">The Fund offers and issues Shares at their
net asset value (&ldquo;NAV&rdquo;) only in aggregations of a specified number of Shares (each, a &ldquo;Creation Unit&rdquo;).
The Fund generally offers and issues Shares in exchange for a basket of securities (&ldquo;Deposit Securities&rdquo;) together
with the deposit of a specified cash payment (&ldquo;Cash Component&rdquo;). The Trust reserves the right to permit or require
the substitution of a &ldquo;cash in lieu&rdquo; amount (&ldquo;Deposit Cash&rdquo;) to be added to the Cash Component to replace
any Deposit Security. Shares are or will be listed on [Exchange] (the &ldquo;Exchange&rdquo;). Shares trade on the Exchange at
market prices that may differ from the Shares&rsquo; NAV. Shares are also redeemable only in Creation Unit aggregations, primarily
for a basket of Deposit Securities together with a Cash Component. As a practical matter, only institutions or large investors,
known as &ldquo;Authorized Participants&rdquo; or &ldquo;APs,&rdquo; purchase or redeem Creation Units. Except when aggregated
in Creation Units, Shares are not individually redeemable.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">Shares may be issued in advance of receipt
of Deposit Securities subject to various conditions, including a requirement to maintain on deposit with the Trust cash at least
equal to a specified percentage of the value of the missing Deposit Securities, as set forth in the Participant Agreement (as defined
below). The Trust may impose a transaction fee for each creation or redemption. In all cases, such fees will be limited in accordance
with the requirements of the SEC applicable to management investment companies offering redeemable securities. As in the case of
other publicly traded securities, brokers&rsquo; commissions on transactions in the secondary market will be based on negotiated

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">The Fund is &ldquo;diversified&rdquo; within
the meaning of the 1940 Act. Under applicable federal laws, to qualify as a diversified fund, the Fund, with respect to 75% of
its total assets, may not invest greater than 5% of its total assets in any one issuer and may not hold greater than 10% of the
securities of one issuer, other than investments in cash and cash items (including receivables), U.S. government securities, and
securities of other investment companies. The remaining 25% of the Fund&rsquo;s total assets does not need to be &ldquo;diversified&rdquo;
and may be invested in securities of a single issuer, subject to other applicable laws. The diversification of the Fund&rsquo;s
holdings is measured at the time the Fund purchases a security. However, if the Fund purchases a security and holds it for a period
of time, the security may become a larger percentage of the Fund&rsquo;s total assets due to movements in the financial markets.
If the market affects several securities held by the Fund, the Fund may have a greater percentage of its assets invested in securities
of fewer issuers.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">In addition, the Fund intends to maintain
the required level of diversification and otherwise conduct its operations so as to qualify as a RIC for purposes of the Code,
and to relieve the Fund of any liability for federal income tax to the extent that its earnings are distributed to shareholders.
Compliance with the diversification requirements of the Code may limit the investment flexibility of the Fund and may make it less
likely that the Fund will meet its investment objectives. See &ldquo;Federal Income Taxes&rdquo; in this SAI for further discussion.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">The following are descriptions of the permitted
investments and investment practices and associated risk factors. The Fund will invest in any of the following instruments or engage
in any of the following investment practices only if such investment or activity is consistent with the Fund&rsquo;s investment
objective and permitted by the Fund&rsquo;s stated investment policies. In addition, certain of the techniques and investments
discussed in this SAI are not principal strategies of the Fund as disclosed in the Prospectus, and while such techniques and investments
are permissible for the Fund to utilize, the Fund is not required to utilize such non-principal techniques or investments. Further,
some of following risk descriptions apply to the Funds only indirectly via other ETFs and, to a limited extent, exchange traded

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">As noted in the prospectus, the Fund is
a &ldquo;fund of funds,&rdquo; meaning that it invests its assets in the shares of Underlying ETFs, rather than in stocks, bonds,
derivative instruments or other types of securities and instruments. The Fund&rsquo;s portfolio will be primarily composed of affiliated
Underlying ETFs advised by the Fund&rsquo;s investment adviser, Tidal Investments LLC (the &ldquo;Adviser&rdquo;). Currently, there
are over [ ] eligible Underlying ETFs for investment, excluding other fund-of funds and other ETFs that invest more than 10 percent
of their assets in other investment companies and private funds. Additionally, the Fund will not invest in daily leveraged ETFs,
such as ETFs that seek daily investment results that correspond to a multiple (e.g., two times (2x)) the return of an underlying
security or index. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Fund may invest in Underlying ETFs that otherwise use significant amounts
of leverage.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">Although the Fund does not intend to borrow
money, the Fund may do so to the extent permitted by the 1940 Act. Under the 1940 Act, the Fund may borrow up to one-third (1/3)
of its total assets. Borrowing will tend to exaggerate the effect on NAV of any increase or decrease in the market value of the
Fund&rsquo;s portfolio. Money borrowed will be subject to interest costs that may or may not be recovered by earnings on the securities
purchased. The Fund also may be required to maintain minimum average balances in connection with a borrowing or to pay a commitment
or other fee to maintain a line of credit; either of these requirements would increase the cost of borrowing over the stated interest
rate.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">Equity securities, such as the common stocks
of an issuer, are subject to stock market fluctuations and therefore may experience volatile changes in value as market conditions,
consumer sentiment or the financial condition of the issuers change. A decrease in value of the equity securities in an Underlying
ETF&rsquo;s portfolio may also cause the value of an Underlying ETF&rsquo;s Shares to decline.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">An investment in the Fund should be made
with an understanding of the risks inherent in an investment in equity securities, including the risk that the financial condition
of issuers may become impaired or that the general condition of the stock market may deteriorate (either of which may cause a decrease
in the value of an Underlying ETF&rsquo;s portfolio securities and therefore a decrease in the value of Shares of an Underlying
ETF). Common stocks are susceptible to general stock market fluctuations and to volatile increases and decreases in value as market
confidence and perceptions change. These investor perceptions are based on various and unpredictable factors, including expectations
regarding government, economic, monetary and fiscal policies; inflation and interest rates; economic expansion or contraction;
and global or regional political, economic or banking crises.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">Holders of common stocks incur more risk
than holders of preferred stocks and debt obligations because common stockholders, as owners of the issuer, generally have inferior
rights to receive payments from the issuer in comparison with the rights of creditors or holders of debt obligations or preferred
stocks. Further, unlike debt securities, which typically have a stated principal amount payable at maturity (whose value, however,
is subject to market fluctuations prior thereto), or preferred stocks, which typically have a liquidation preference and which
may have stated optional or mandatory redemption provisions, common stocks have neither a fixed principal amount nor a maturity.
Common stock values are subject to market fluctuations as long as the common stock remains outstanding.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify"><I>Common Stocks</I>. Common stocks represent
units of ownership in a company. Common stocks usually carry voting rights and earn dividends. Unlike preferred stocks, which are
described below, dividends on common stocks are not fixed but are declared at the discretion of the company&rsquo;s board of directors.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify"><I>Preferred Stocks.</I> Preferred stocks
are also units of ownership in a company. Preferred stocks normally have preference over common stock in the payment of dividends
and the liquidation of the company. However, in all other respects, preferred stocks are subordinated to the liabilities of the
issuer. Unlike common stocks, preferred stocks are generally not entitled to vote on corporate matters. Types of preferred stocks
include adjustable-rate preferred stock, fixed dividend preferred stock, perpetual preferred stock, and sinking fund preferred
stock.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">Generally, the market values of preferred
stock with a fixed dividend rate and no conversion element vary inversely with interest rates and perceived credit risk.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify"><I>Rights and Warrants</I>. A right is
a privilege granted to existing shareholders of a corporation to subscribe to shares of a new issue of common stock before it is
issued. Rights normally have a short life of usually two to four weeks, are freely transferable and entitle the holder to buy the
new common stock at a lower price than the public offering price. Warrants are securities that are usually issued together with
a debt security or preferred stock and that give the holder the right to buy proportionate amount of common stock at a specified
price. Warrants are freely transferable and are traded on major exchanges. Unlike rights, warrants normally have a life that is
measured in years and entitles the holder to buy common stock of a company at a price that is usually higher than the market price
at the time the warrant is issued. Corporations often issue warrants to make the accompanying debt security more attractive.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">An investment in warrants and rights may
entail greater risks than certain other types of investments. Generally, rights and warrants do not carry the right to receive
dividends or exercise voting rights with respect to the underlying securities, and they do not represent any rights in the assets
of the issuer. In addition, their value does not necessarily change with the value of the underlying securities, and they cease
to have value if they are not exercised on or before their expiration date. Investing in rights and warrants increases the potential
profit or loss to be realized from the investment as compared with investing the same amount in the underlying securities.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify"><I>Smaller Companies</I>. The securities
of small- and mid-capitalization companies may be more vulnerable to adverse issuer, market, political, or economic developments
than securities of larger-capitalization companies. The securities of small- and mid-capitalization companies generally trade in
lower volumes and are subject to greater and more unpredictable price changes than larger capitalization stocks or the stock market
as a whole. Some small- or mid-capitalization companies have limited product lines, markets, and financial and managerial resources
and tend to concentrate on fewer geographical markets relative to larger capitalization companies. There is typically less publicly
available information concerning small- and mid-capitalization companies than for larger, more established companies. Small- and
mid-capitalization companies also may be particularly sensitive to changes in interest rates, government regulation, borrowing
costs, and earnings.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify"><I>Tracking Stocks</I>. The Underlying
ETFs may invest in tracking stocks. A tracking stock is a separate class of common stock whose value is linked to a specific business
unit or operating division within a larger company and which is designed to &ldquo;track&rdquo; the performance of such business
unit or division. The tracking stock may pay dividends to shareholders independent of the parent company. The parent company, rather
than the business unit or division, generally is the issuer of tracking stock. However, holders of the tracking stock may not have
the same rights as holders of the company&rsquo;s common stock.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify"><I>When-Issued Securities</I>. A when-issued
security is one whose terms are available and for which a market exists, but which has not been issued. When an Underlying ETF
engages in when-issued transactions, it relies on the other party to consummate the sale. If the other party fails to complete
the sale, an Underlying ETF may miss the opportunity to obtain the security at a favorable price or yield.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">When purchasing a security on a when-issued
basis, an Underlying ETF assumes the rights and risks of ownership of the security, including the risk of price and yield changes.
At the time of settlement, the value of the security may be more or less than the purchase price. The yield available in the market
when the delivery takes place also may be higher than those obtained in the transaction itself. Because an Underlying ETF does
not pay for the security until the delivery date, these risks are in addition to the risks associated with its other investments.</P>

the limitation on the issuance of senior securities in Section 18 of the 1940 Act, provided that the Fund intends to physically
settle the transaction and the transaction will settle within 35 days of its trade date (the &ldquo;Delayed-Settlement Securities

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify"><FONT STYLE="background-color: white">An
Underlying ETF, subject to its investment strategies and policies, may invest in one or more derivatives. </FONT>Generally, derivatives
are financial instruments whose value depends on or is derived from, the value of one or more underlying assets, reference rates,
or indices or other market factors (a &ldquo;reference instrument&rdquo;) and may relate to stocks, bonds, interest rates, credit,
currencies, commodities or related indices. Derivative instruments can provide an efficient means to gain or reduce exposure to
the value of a reference instrument without actually owning or selling the instrument. Some common types of derivatives include
options, futures, forwards and swaps.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">Derivative instruments may be used to modify
the effective duration of an Underlying ETF&rsquo;s portfolio investments. Derivative instruments may also be used for &ldquo;hedging,&rdquo;
which means that they may be used when the Sub-Adviser seeks to protect an Underlying ETF&rsquo;s investments from a decline in
value resulting from changes to interest rates, market prices, currency fluctuations, or other market factors. Derivative instruments
may also be used for other purposes, including to seek to increase liquidity, provide efficient portfolio management, broaden investment
opportunities (including taking short or negative positions), implement a tax or cash management strategy, gain exposure to a particular
security or segment of the market and/or enhance total return. However derivative instruments are used, their successful use is
not assured and will depend upon, among other factors, the Sub-Adviser&rsquo;s ability to gauge relevant market movements.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">Derivative instruments may be used for
the purpose of direct hedging. Direct hedging means that the transaction must be intended to reduce a specific risk exposure of
a portfolio security or its denominated currency and must also be directly related to such security or currency. The Fund&rsquo;s
use of derivative instruments may be limited from time to time by policies adopted by the Board, the Adviser or the Sub-Adviser.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">SEC Rule 18f-4 (&ldquo;Rule 18f-4&rdquo;
or the &ldquo;Derivatives Rule&rdquo;) regulates the ability of an Underlying ETF&nbsp;to enter into derivative transactions and
other leveraged transactions. The Derivatives Rule defines the term &ldquo;derivatives&rdquo; to include short sales and forward
contracts, such as TBA transactions, in addition to instruments traditionally classified as derivatives, such as swaps, futures,
and options. Rule 18f-4 also regulates other types of leveraged transactions, such as reverse repurchase transactions and transactions
deemed to be &ldquo;similar to&rdquo; reverse repurchase transactions, such as certain securities lending transactions in connection
with which an Underlying ETF obtains leverage. Among other things, under Rule 18f-4, an Underlying ETF is prohibited from entering
into these derivatives transactions except in reliance on the provisions of the Derivatives Rule. The Derivatives Rule establishes
limits on the derivatives transactions that an Underlying ETF may enter into based on the value-at-risk (&ldquo;VaR&rdquo;) of
the Fund inclusive of derivatives. An Underlying ETF will generally satisfy the limits under the Rule if the VaR of its portfolio
(inclusive of derivatives transactions) does not exceed 200% of the VaR of its &ldquo;designated reference portfolio.&rdquo; The
&ldquo;designated reference portfolio&rdquo; is a representative unleveraged index or an Underlying ETF&rsquo;s own portfolio absent
derivatives holdings, as determined by such Underlying ETF&rsquo;s derivatives risk manager. This limits test is referred to as
the &ldquo;Relative VaR Test.&rdquo; As a result of the Relative VaR Test, an Underlying ETF may not seek returns in excess of
2x the designated reference portfolio.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">In addition, among other requirements,
Rule 18f-4 requires an Underlying ETF to establish a derivatives risk management program, appoint a derivatives risk manager, and
carry out enhanced reporting to the Board, the SEC and the public regarding an Underlying ETF&rsquo;s derivatives activities. These
new requirements will apply unless an Underlying ETF qualifies as a &ldquo;limited derivatives user,&rdquo; which the Derivatives
Rule defines as a fund that limits its derivatives exposure to 10% of its net assets. It is possible that the limits and compliance
costs imposed by the Derivatives Rule may adversely affect an Underlying ETF&rsquo;s performance, efficiency in implementing its
strategy, liquidity and/or ability to pursue its investment objectives and may increase the cost of such Underlying ETF&rsquo;s
investments and cost of doing business, which could adversely affect investors.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify"><I>Futures contracts</I>. Generally, a
futures contract is a standard binding agreement to buy or sell a specified quantity of an underlying reference instrument, such
as a specific security, currency or commodity, at a specified price at a specified later date. A &ldquo;sale&rdquo; of a futures
contract means the acquisition of a contractual obligation to deliver the underlying reference instrument called for by the contract
at a specified price on a specified date. A &ldquo;purchase&rdquo; of a futures contract means the acquisition of a contractual
obligation to acquire the underlying reference instrument called for by the contract at a specified price on a specified date.
The purchase or sale of a futures contract will allow an Underlying ETF to increase or decrease its exposure to the underlying
reference instrument without having to buy the actual instrument.</P>

which futures contracts may relate include non-U.S. currencies, interest rates, stock and bond indices, and debt securities, including
U.S. government debt obligations. In certain types of futures contracts, the underlying reference instrument may be a swap agreement.
In most cases the contractual obligation under a futures contract may be offset, or &ldquo;closed out,&rdquo; before the settlement
date so that the parties do not have to make or take delivery. The closing out of a contractual obligation is usually accomplished
by buying or selling, as the case may be, an identical, offsetting futures contract. This transaction, which is effected through
a member of an exchange, cancels the obligation to make or take delivery of the underlying instrument or asset. Although some futures
contracts by their terms require the actual delivery or acquisition of the underlying instrument or asset, some require cash settlement.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">Futures contracts may be bought and sold
on U.S. and non-U.S. exchanges. Futures contracts in the U.S. have been designed by exchanges that have been designated &ldquo;contract
markets&rdquo; by the CFTC and must be executed through a futures commission merchant (&ldquo;FCM&rdquo;), which is a brokerage
firm that is a member of the relevant contract market. Each exchange guarantees performance of the contracts as between the clearing
members of the exchange, thereby reducing the risk of counterparty default. Futures contracts may also be entered into on certain
exempt markets, including exempt boards of trade and electronic trading facilities, available to certain market participants. Because
all transactions in the futures market are made, offset or fulfilled by an FCM through a clearinghouse associated with the exchange
on which the contracts are traded, an Underlying ETF will incur brokerage fees when they buy or sell futures contracts.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">To the extent an Underlying ETF invests
in futures contracts, such Underlying ETF will generally buy and sell futures contracts only on contract markets (including exchanges
or boards of trade) where there appears to be an active market for the futures contracts, but there is no assurance that an active
market will exist for any particular contract or at any particular time. An active market makes it more likely that futures contracts
will be liquid and bought and sold at competitive market prices. In addition, many of the futures contracts available may be relatively
new instruments without a significant trading history. As a result, there can be no assurance that an active market will develop
or continue to exist.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">When an Underlying ETF enters into a futures
contract, it must deliver to an account controlled by the FCM (that has been selected by the Fund), an amount referred to as &ldquo;initial
margin&rdquo; that is typically calculated as an amount equal to the volatility in market value of a contract over a fixed period.
Initial margin requirements are determined by the respective exchanges on which the futures contracts are traded and the FCM. Thereafter,
a &ldquo;variation margin&rdquo; amount may be required to be paid by the Fund or received by the Fund in accordance with margin
controls set for such accounts, depending upon changes in the marked-to-market value of the futures contract. The account is marked-to-market
daily and the variation margin is monitored the Adviser and Custodian (defined below) on a daily basis. When the futures contract
is closed out, if an Underlying ETF has a loss equal to or greater than the margin amount, the margin amount is paid to the FCM
along with any loss in excess of the margin amount. If an Underlying ETF has a loss of less than the margin amount, the excess
margin is returned to such Underlying ETF. If an Underlying ETF has a gain, the full margin amount and the amount of the gain is
paid to such Underlying ETF.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">Some futures contracts provide for the
delivery of securities that are different than those that are specified in the contract. For a futures contract for delivery of
debt securities, on the settlement date of the contract, adjustments to the contract can be made to recognize differences in value
arising from the delivery of debt securities with a different interest rate from that of the particular debt securities that were
specified in the contract. In some cases, securities called for by a futures contract may not have been issued when the contract
was written.</P>

Underlying ETFs&rsquo; use of futures contracts is subject to the risks associated with derivative instruments generally. In addition,
a purchase or sale of a futures contract may result in losses to the Underlying ETFs in excess of the amount that an Underlying
ETF delivered as initial margin. Because of the relatively low margin deposits required, futures trading involves a high degree
of leverage; as a result, a relatively small price movement in a futures contract may result in immediate and substantial loss,
or gain, to an Underlying ETF. In addition, if an Underlying ETF has insufficient cash to meet daily variation margin requirements
or close out a futures position, it may have to sell securities from its portfolio at a time when it may be disadvantageous to
do so. Adverse market movements could cause an Underlying ETF to experience substantial losses on an investment in a futures contract.</P>

ETFs of the initial and variation margin deposits in the event of bankruptcy of the FCM with which an Underlying ETF has an open

FCM or central counterparty because the Fund might be limited to recovering only a pro rata share of all available funds and margin
segregated on behalf of an FCM&rsquo;s customers. If the FCM does not provide accurate reporting, the Underlying ETFs are also
subject to the risk that the FCM could use an Underlying ETF&rsquo;s assets, which are held in an omnibus account with assets belonging
to the FCM&rsquo;s other customers, to satisfy its own financial obligations or the payment obligations of another customer to
the central counterparty.</P>

performance will be poorer than if it had not entered into a futures contract. For example, if an Underlying ETF has purchased
futures to hedge against the possibility of an increase in interest rates that would adversely affect the price of bonds held in
its portfolio and interest rates instead decrease, such Underlying ETF will lose part or all of the benefit of the increased value
of the bonds which it has hedged. This is because its losses in its futures positions will offset some or all of its gains from

margin requirements, investors may close futures contracts through offsetting transactions that could distort the normal pricing
spread between the cash and futures markets. Second, the liquidity of the futures markets depends on participants entering into
offsetting transactions rather than making or taking delivery of the underlying instrument. To the extent participants decide to
make or take delivery, liquidity in the futures market could be reduced, resulting in pricing distortion. Third, from the point
of view of speculators, the margin deposit requirements that apply in the futures market are less onerous than similar margin requirements
in the securities market. Therefore, increased participation by speculators in the futures market may cause temporary price distortions.</P>

established limits referred to as &ldquo;speculative position limits&rdquo; on the maximum net long or net short position that
any person, such as the Underlying ETFs, may hold or control in a particular futures contract. Trading limits are also imposed
on the maximum number of contracts that any person may trade on a particular trading day. An exchange may order the liquidation

amount that the price of a futures contract may vary either up or down from the previous day&rsquo;s settlement price. Once the
daily limit has been reached in a futures contract subject to the limit, no more trades may be made on that day at a price beyond
that limit. The daily limit governs only price movements during a particular trading day and does not limit potential losses because
the limit may prevent the liquidation of unfavorable positions. For example, futures prices have occasionally moved to the daily
limit for several consecutive trading days with little or no trading, thereby preventing prompt liquidation of positions and subjecting
some holders of futures contracts to substantial losses.</P>

on futures contracts trade on the same contract markets as the underlying futures contract. When an Underlying ETF buys an option,
it pays a premium for the right, but does not have the obligation, to purchase (call) or sell (put) a futures contract at a set
price (the exercise price). The purchase of a call or put option on a futures contract, whereby an Underlying ETF has the right
to purchase or sell, respectively, a particular futures contract, is similar in some respects to the purchase of a call or put
option on an individual security or currency. Depending on the premium paid for the option compared to either the price of the
futures contract upon which it is based or the price of the underlying reference instrument, the option may be less risky than
direct ownership of the futures contract or the underlying reference instrument. For example, an Underlying ETF could purchase
a call option on a long futures contract when seeking to hedge against an increase in the market value of the underlying reference
instrument, such as appreciation in the value of a non-U.S. currency against the U.S. dollar.</P>

An Underlying ETF&rsquo;s use of options on futures contracts is subject to the risks related to derivative instruments generally.
In addition, the amount of risk an Underlying ETF assumes when it purchases an option on a futures contract is the premium paid
for the option plus related transaction costs. The purchase of an option also entails the risk that changes in the value of the
underlying futures contract will not be fully reflected in the value of the option purchased. The seller (writer) of an option
on a futures contract is subject to the risk of having to take a possibly adverse futures position if the purchaser of the option
exercises its rights. If the seller were required to take such a position, it could bear substantial losses. An option writer has
potentially unlimited economic risk because its potential loss, except to the extent offset by the premium received, is equal to
the amount the option is &ldquo;in-the-money&rdquo; at the expiration date. A call option is in-the-money if the value of the underlying
futures contract exceeds the exercise price of the option. A put option is in-the-money if the exercise price of the option exceeds
the value of the underlying futures contract.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify"><I>Options</I>. An option is a contract
that gives the purchaser of the option, in return for the premium paid, the right to buy an underlying reference instrument, such
as a specified security, currency, index, or other instrument, from the writer of the option (in the case of a call option), or
to sell a specified reference instrument to the writer of the option (in the case of a put option) at a designated price during
the term of the option. The premium paid by the buyer of an option will reflect, among other things, the relationship of the exercise
price to the market price and the volatility of the underlying reference instrument, the remaining term of the option, supply,
demand, interest rates and/or currency exchange rates. An American style put or call option may be exercised at any time during
the option period while a European style put or call option may be exercised only upon expiration or during a fixed period prior
thereto. Put and call options are traded on national securities exchanges and in the OTC market.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">Options traded on national securities exchanges
are within the jurisdiction of the SEC or other appropriate national securities regulator, as are securities traded on such exchanges.
As a result, many of the protections provided to traders on organized exchanges will be available with respect to such transactions.
In particular, all option positions entered into on a national securities exchange in the United States are cleared and guaranteed
by the Options Clearing Corporation, thereby reducing the risk of counterparty default. Furthermore, a liquid secondary market
in options traded on a national securities exchange may be more readily available than in the OTC market, potentially permitting
an Underlying ETF to liquidate open positions at a profit prior to exercise or expiration, or to limit losses in the event of adverse
market movements. There is no assurance, however, that higher than anticipated trading activity or other unforeseen events might
not temporarily render the capabilities of the Options Clearing Corporation inadequate, and thereby result in the exchange instituting
special procedures which may interfere with the timely execution of an Underlying ETF&rsquo;s orders to close out open options
positions.</P>

As the buyer of a call option, an Underlying ETF has a right to buy the underlying reference instrument (e.g., a currency or security)
at the exercise price at any time during the option period (for American style options). The Underlying ETFs may enter into closing
sale transactions with respect to call options, exercise them, or permit them to expire. For example, an Underlying ETF may buy
call options on underlying reference instruments that it intends to buy with the goal of limiting the risk of a substantial increase
in their market price before the purchase is effected. Unless the price of the underlying reference instrument changes sufficiently,
a call option purchased by an Underlying ETF may expire without any value to the Fund, in which case such Underlying ETF would
experience a loss to the extent of the premium paid for the option plus related transaction costs.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">As the buyer of a put option, an Underlying
ETF has the right to sell the underlying reference instrument at the exercise price at any time during the option period (for American
style options). Like a call option, the Underlying ETFs may enter into closing sale transactions with respect to put options, exercise
them or permit them to expire. An Underlying ETF may buy a put option on an underlying reference instrument owned by the Fund (a
protective put) as a hedging technique in an attempt to protect against an anticipated decline in the market value of the underlying
reference instrument. Such hedge protection is provided only during the life of the put option when the Fund, as the buyer of the
put option, is able to sell the underlying reference instrument at the put exercise price, regardless of any decline in the underlying
instrument&rsquo;s market price. The Underlying ETFs may also seek to offset a decline in the value of the underlying reference
instrument through appreciation in the value of the put option. A put option may also be purchased with the intent of protecting
unrealized appreciation of an instrument when the Sub-Adviser deems it desirable to continue to hold the instrument because of
tax or other considerations. The premium paid for the put option and any transaction costs would reduce any short-term capital
gain that may be available for distribution when the instrument is eventually sold. Buying put options at a time when the buyer
does not own the underlying reference instrument allows the buyer to benefit from a decline in the market price of the underlying
reference instrument, which generally increases the value of the put option.</P>

closing sale transaction when it has remaining value, and if the market price of the underlying reference instrument remains equal
to or greater than the exercise price during the life of the put option, the buyer would not make any gain upon exercise of the
option and would experience a loss to the extent of the premium paid for the option plus related transaction costs. In order for
the purchase of a put option to be profitable, the market price of the underlying reference instrument must decline sufficiently
below the exercise price to cover the premium and transaction costs.</P>

purchased (in the case of a put option) because the writer may be notified of exercise at any time prior to the expiration of the
option (for American style options). In general, though, options are infrequently exercised prior to expiration. Whether or not
an option expires unexercised, the writer retains the amount of the premium. Writing &ldquo;covered&rdquo; call options means that
the writer owns the underlying reference instrument that is subject to the call option. Call options may also be written on reference
instruments that the writer does not own.</P>

sell the underlying reference instruments that are subject to the written call option until it either effects a closing transaction
with respect to the written call, or otherwise satisfies the conditions for release of the underlying reference instruments from
segregation. As the writer of a covered call option, an Underlying ETF gives up the potential for capital appreciation above the
exercise price of the option should the underlying reference instrument rise in value. If the value of the underlying reference
instrument rises above the exercise price of the call option, the reference instrument will likely be &ldquo;called away,&rdquo;
requiring an Underlying ETF to sell the underlying instrument at the exercise price. In that case, the Fund will sell the underlying
reference instrument to the option buyer for less than its market value, and such Underlying ETF will experience a loss (which
will be offset by the premium received by the Fund as the writer of such option). If a call option expires unexercised, the Fund
will realize a gain in the amount of the premium received. If the market price of the underlying reference instrument decreases,
the call option will not be exercised and the Fund will be able to use the amount of the premium received to hedge against the
loss in value of the underlying reference instrument. The exercise price of a call option will be chosen based upon the expected
price movement of the underlying reference instrument. The exercise price of a call option may be below, equal to (at-the-money),

declines below the exercise price of the put option and the put option is exercised, the Fund, as the writer of the put option,
will be required to buy the instrument at the exercise price, which will exceed the market value of the underlying reference instrument
at that time. An Underlying ETF will incur a loss to the extent that the current market value of the underlying reference instrument
is less than the exercise price of the put option. However, the loss will be offset in part by the premium received from the buyer
of the put. If a put option written by an Underlying ETF expires unexercised, such Underlying ETF will realize a gain in the amount

options)</I>. If the writer of an option wants to terminate its obligation, the writer may effect a &ldquo;closing purchase transaction&rdquo;
by buying an option of the same series as the option previously written. The effect of the purchase is that the clearing corporation
will cancel the option writer&rsquo;s position. However, a writer may not effect a closing purchase transaction after being notified
of the exercise of an option. Likewise, the buyer of an option may recover all or a portion of the premium that it paid by effecting
a &ldquo;closing sale transaction&rdquo; by selling an option of the same series as the option previously purchased and receiving
a premium on the sale. There is no guarantee that either a closing purchase or a closing sale transaction may be made at a time
desired by an Underlying ETF. Closing transactions allow an Underlying ETF to terminate its positions in written and purchased
options. An Underlying ETF will realize a profit from a closing transaction if the price of the transaction is less than the premium
received from writing the original option (in the case of written options) or is more than the premium paid by the Fund to buy
the option (in the case of purchased options). For example, increases in the market price of a call option sold by an Underlying
ETF will generally reflect increases in the market price of the underlying reference instrument. As a result, any loss resulting
from a closing transaction on a written call option is likely to be offset in whole or in part by appreciation of the underlying
instrument owned by the Fund.</P>

meet its credit quality standards, in unusual or extreme market conditions, a counterparty&rsquo;s creditworthiness and ability
to perform may deteriorate rapidly, and the availability of suitable replacement counterparties may become limited. Because there
is no exchange, pricing is typically done based on information from market makers or other dealers. OTC options are available for

liquid secondary market will exist for any particular OTC option at any specific time. The Underlying ETFs may be able to realize
the value of an OTC option it has purchased only by exercising it or entering into a closing sale transaction with the dealer that
issued it. When an Underlying ETF writes an OTC option, it generally can close out that option prior to its expiration only by
entering into a closing purchase transaction with the dealer with which such Underlying ETF originally wrote the option. An Underlying
ETF may suffer a loss if it is not able to exercise (in the case of a purchased option) or enter into a closing sale transaction

rate cap is a type of OTC option. The buyer of an interest rate cap pays a premium to the seller in exchange for payments at set
intervals for which a floating interest rate exceeds an agreed upon interest rate. The floating interest rate may be tied to a
reference rate, a long-term swap rate or other benchmark. The amount of each payment is determined by reference to a specified
&ldquo;notional&rdquo; amount of money. Interest rate caps do not involve the delivery of securities, other underlying instruments,
or principal amounts. Accordingly, barring counterparty risk, the risk of loss to the purchaser of an interest rate cap is limited
to the amount of the premium paid.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">An interest rate cap can be used to increase
or decrease exposure to various interest rates, including to hedge interest rate risk. By purchasing an interest rate cap, the
buyer of the cap can benefit from rising interest rates while limiting its downside risk to the amount of the premium paid. If
an Underlying ETF buys an interest rate cap and the Adviser is correct at predicting the direction of interest rates, the interest
rate cap will increase in value. But if the Adviser is incorrect at predicting the direction, the interest rate cap will expire
worthless.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">By writing (selling) an interest rate cap,
the seller of the cap can benefit by receiving a premium in exchange for assuming an obligation to make payments at set intervals
for which a floating interest rate exceeds an agreed upon interest rate. If interest rates rise above the agreed upon cap, the
seller&rsquo;s obligation to make payments may result in losses in excess of the premium received.</P>

rate cap requires an understanding of the referenced interest rate, and an Underlying ETF bears the risk that the Adviser will
not correctly forecast future market events, such as interest rate movements. Interest rate caps also involve the risks associated
with derivative instruments generally, as described herein, including the risks associated with OTC options.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify"><I>Risks of options</I>. The Underlying
ETFs&rsquo; options investments involve certain risks, including general risks related to derivative instruments. There can be
no assurance that a liquid secondary market on an exchange will exist for any particular option, or at any particular time, and
the Underlying ETFs may have difficulty effecting closing transactions in particular options. Therefore, an Underlying ETF would
have to exercise the options it purchased in order to realize any profit, thus taking or making delivery of the underlying reference
instrument when not desired. An Underlying ETF could then incur transaction costs upon the sale of the underlying reference instruments.
Similarly, when an Underlying ETF cannot affect a closing transaction with respect to a put option it wrote, and the buyer exercises,
such Underlying ETF would be required to take delivery and would incur transaction costs upon the sale of the underlying reference
instruments purchased. If an Underlying ETF, as a covered call option writer, is unable to affect a closing purchase transaction
in a secondary market, it will not be able to sell the underlying reference instrument until the option expires, it delivers the
underlying instrument upon exercise, or it segregates enough liquid assets to purchase the underlying reference instrument at the
marked-to-market price during the term of the option. When trading options on non-U.S. exchanges or in the OTC market, many of
the protections afforded to exchange participants will not be available. For example, there may be no daily price fluctuation limits,
and adverse market movements could therefore continue to an unlimited extent over an indefinite period of time.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">The effectiveness of an options strategy
for hedging depends on the degree to which price movements in the underlying reference instruments correlate with price movements
in the relevant portion of the Fund&rsquo;s portfolio that is being hedged. In addition, an Underlying ETF bears the risk that
the prices of its portfolio investments will not move in the same amount as the option it has purchased or sold for hedging purposes,
or that there may be a negative correlation that would result in a loss on both the investments and the option. If the Sub-Adviser
is not successful in using options in managing an Underlying ETF&rsquo;s investments, such Underlying ETF&rsquo;s performance will
be worse than if the Sub-Adviser did not employ such strategies.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify"><I>Swaps</I>. Generally, swap agreements
are contracts between an Underlying ETF and another party (the swap counterparty) involving the exchange of payments on specified
terms over periods ranging from a few days to multiple years. A swap agreement may be negotiated bilaterally and traded OTC between
the two parties (for an uncleared swap) or, in some instances, must be transacted through an FCM and cleared through a clearinghouse
that serves as a central counterparty (for a cleared swap). In a basic swap transaction, an Underlying ETF agrees with the swap
counterparty to exchange the returns (or differentials in rates of return) and/or cash flows earned or realized on a particular
&ldquo;notional amount&rdquo; or value of predetermined underlying reference instruments. The notional amount is the set dollar
or other value selected by the parties to use as the basis on which to calculate the obligations that the parties to a swap agreement
have agreed to exchange. The parties typically do not actually exchange the notional amount. Instead, they agree to exchange the
returns that would be earned or realized if the notional amount were invested in given investments or at given interest rates.
Examples of returns that may be exchanged in a swap agreement are those of a particular security, a particular fixed or variable
interest rate, a particular non-U.S. currency, or a &ldquo;basket&rdquo; of securities representing a particular index. Swaps can
also be based on credit and other events.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">The Underlying ETFs will generally enter
into swap agreements on a net basis, which means that the two payment streams that are to be made by an Underlying ETF and its
counterparty with respect to a particular swap agreement are netted out, with such Underlying ETF receiving or paying, as the case
may be, only the net difference in the two payments. An Underlying ETF&rsquo;s obligations (or rights) under a swap agreement that
is entered into on a net basis will generally be the net amount to be paid or received under the agreement based on the relative
values of the obligations of each party upon termination of the agreement or at set valuation dates. An Underlying ETF will accrue
its obligations under a swap agreement daily (offset by any amounts the counterparty owes such Underlying ETF). If the swap agreement
does not provide for that type of netting, the full amount of the Fund&rsquo;s obligations will be accrued on a daily basis.</P>

The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the &ldquo;Dodd-Frank Act&rdquo;) and related regulatory
developments imposed comprehensive regulatory requirements on swaps and swap market participants. The regulatory framework includes:
(1) registration and regulation of swap dealers and major swap participants; (2) requiring central clearing and execution of standardized
swaps; (3) imposing margin requirements on swap transactions; (4) regulating and monitoring swap transactions through position
limits and large trader reporting requirements; and (5) imposing record keeping and centralized and public reporting requirements,
on an anonymous basis, for most swaps. The CFTC is responsible for the regulation of most swaps. The SEC has jurisdiction over
a small segment of the market referred to as &ldquo;security-based swaps,&rdquo; which includes swaps on single securities or credits,
or narrow-based indices of securities or credits.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify"><I>Uncleared swaps</I>. In an uncleared
swap, the swap counterparty is typically a brokerage firm, bank or other financial institution. The Underlying ETFs customarily
enter into uncleared swaps based on the standard terms and conditions of an International Swaps and Derivatives Association (&ldquo;ISDA&rdquo;)
Master Agreement. ISDA is a voluntary industry association of participants in the over-the-counter derivatives markets that has
developed standardized contracts used by such participants that have agreed to be bound by such standardized contracts. In the
event that one party to a swap transaction defaults and the transaction is terminated prior to its scheduled termination date,
one of the parties may be required to make an early termination payment to the other. An early termination payment may be payable
by either the defaulting or non-defaulting party, depending upon which of them is &ldquo;in-the-money&rdquo; with respect to the
swap at the time of its termination. Early termination payments may be calculated in various ways, but are intended to approximate
the amount the &ldquo;in-the-money&rdquo; party would have to pay to replace the swap as of the date of its termination.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">During the term of an uncleared swap, an
Underlying ETF is required to pledge to the swap counterparty, from time to time, an amount of cash and/or other assets equal to
the total net amount (if any) that would be payable by such Underlying ETF to the counterparty if all outstanding swaps between
the parties were terminated on the date in question, including any early termination payments (&ldquo;variation margin&rdquo;).
Periodically, changes in the amount pledged are made to recognize changes in value of the contract resulting from, among other
things, interest on the notional value of the contract, market value changes in the underlying investment, and/or dividends paid
by the issuer of the underlying instrument. Likewise, the counterparty will be required to pledge cash or other assets to cover
its obligations to the Fund. However, the amount pledged may not always be equal to or more than the amount due to the other party.
Therefore, if a counterparty defaults in its obligations to an Underlying ETF, the amount pledged by the counterparty and available
to such Underlying ETF may not be sufficient to cover all the amounts due to the Fund and the Fund may sustain a loss.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">Currently, the Underlying ETFs do not intend
to typically provide initial margin in connection with uncleared swaps. However, rules requiring initial margin for uncleared swaps
have been adopted and are being phased in over time. When these rules take effect, if an Underlying ETF is deemed to have material
swaps exposure under applicable swap regulations, the Fund will be required to post initial margin in addition to variation margin.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify"><I>Cleared swaps</I>. Certain standardized
swaps are subject to mandatory central clearing and exchange-trading. The Dodd-Frank Act and implementing rules will ultimately
require the clearing and exchange-trading of many swaps. Mandatory exchange-trading and clearing will occur on a phased-in basis
based on the type of market participant, CFTC approval of contracts for central clearing and public trading facilities making such
cleared swaps available to trade. To date, the CFTC has designated only certain of the most common types of credit default index
swaps and interest rate swaps as subject to mandatory clearing and certain public trading facilities have made certain of those
cleared swaps available to trade, but it is expected that additional categories of swaps will in the future be designated as subject
to mandatory clearing and trade execution requirements. Central clearing is intended to reduce counterparty credit risk and increase
liquidity, but central clearing does not eliminate these risks and may involve additional costs and risks not involved with uncleared
swaps. See &ldquo;Risks of cleared swaps&rdquo; below.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">In a cleared swap, an Underlying ETF&rsquo;s
ultimate counterparty is a central clearinghouse rather than a brokerage firm, bank or other financial institution. Cleared swaps
are submitted for clearing through each party&rsquo;s FCM, which must be a member of the clearinghouse that serves as the central
counterparty. Transactions executed on a swap execution facility (&ldquo;SEF&rdquo;) may increase market transparency and liquidity
but may require an Underlying ETF to incur increased expenses to access the same types of swaps that it has used in the past. When
an Underlying ETF enters into a cleared swap, it must deliver to the central counterparty (via the FCM) an amount referred to as
&ldquo;initial margin.&rdquo; Initial margin requirements are determined by the central counterparty and are typically calculated
as an amount equal to the volatility in market value of the cleared swap over a fixed period, but an FCM may require additional
initial margin above the amount required by the central counterparty. During the term of the swap agreement, a &ldquo;variation
margin&rdquo; amount may also be required to be paid by an Underlying ETF or may be received by an Underlying ETF in accordance
with margin controls set for such accounts. If the value of an Underlying ETF&rsquo;s cleared swap declines, the Fund will be required
to make additional &ldquo;variation margin&rdquo; payments to the FCM to settle the change in value. Conversely, if the market
value of an Underlying ETF&rsquo;s position increases, the FCM will post additional &ldquo;variation margin&rdquo; to the Fund&rsquo;s
account. At the conclusion of the term of the swap agreement, if an Underlying ETF has a loss equal to or greater than the margin
amount, the margin amount is paid to the FCM along with any loss in excess of the margin amount. If the Fund has a loss of less
than the margin amount, the excess margin is returned to the Fund. If the Fund has a gain, the full margin amount and the amount
of the gain is paid to the Fund.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify"><I>Credit default swaps</I>. The &ldquo;buyer&rdquo;
of protection in a credit default swap agreement is obligated to pay the &ldquo;seller&rdquo; a periodic stream of payments over
the term of the agreement in return for a payment by the &ldquo;seller&rdquo; that is contingent upon the occurrence of a credit
event with respect to a specific underlying reference debt obligation (whether as a single debt instrument or as part of an index
of debt instruments). The contingent payment by the seller generally is the face amount of the debt obligation, in return for the
buyer&rsquo;s obligation to make periodic cash payments and deliver in physical form the reference debt obligation or a cash payment
equal to the then-current market value of that debt obligation at the time of the credit event. If no credit event occurs, the
seller would receive a fixed rate of income throughout the term of the contract, while the buyer would lose the amount of its payments
and recover nothing. The buyer is also subject to the risk that the seller will not satisfy its contingent payment obligation,
if and when due.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">Purchasing protection through a credit
default swap may be used to attempt to hedge against a decline in the value of debt security or securities due to a credit event.
The seller of protection under a credit default swap receives periodic payments from the buyer but is exposed to the risk that
the value of the reference debt obligation declines due to a credit event and that it will have to pay the face amount of the reference
obligation to the buyer. Selling protection under a credit default swap may also permit the seller to gain exposure that is similar
to owning the reference debt obligation directly. As the seller of protection, an Underlying ETF would effectively add leverage
to its portfolio because, in addition to its total assets, such Underlying ETF would be subject to the risk that there would be
a credit event and the Fund would have to make a substantial payment in the future.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">Generally, a credit event means bankruptcy,
failure to timely pay interest or principal, obligation acceleration or default, or repudiation or restructuring of the reference
debt obligation. There may be disputes between the buyer or seller of a credit default swap agreement or within the swaps market
as a whole as to whether or not a credit event has occurred or what the payout should be which could result in litigation. In some
instances where there is a dispute in the credit default swap market, a regional Determinations Committee set up by ISDA may make
an official binding determination regarding the existence of credit events with respect to the reference debt obligation of a credit
default swap agreement or, in the case of a credit default swap on an index, with respect to a component of the index underlying
the credit default swap agreement. In the case of a credit default swap on an index, the existence of a credit event is determined
according to the index methodology, which may in turn refer to determinations made by ISDA&rsquo;s Determinations Committees with
respect to particular components of the index.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">ISDA&rsquo;s Determinations Committees
are comprised principally of dealers in the OTC derivatives markets which may have a conflicting interest in the determination
regarding the existence of a particular credit event. In addition, in the sovereign debt market, a credit default swap agreement
may not provide the protection generally anticipated because the government issuer of the sovereign debt instruments may be able
to restructure or renegotiate the debt in such a manner as to avoid triggering a credit event. Moreover, (1) sovereign debt obligations
may not incorporate common, commercially acceptable provisions, such as collective action clauses, or (2) the negotiated restructuring
of the sovereign debt may be deemed non-mandatory on all holders. As a result, the determination committee might then not be able
to determine, or may be able to avoid having to determine, that a credit event under the credit default agreement has occurred.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">For these and other reasons, the buyer
of protection in a credit default swap agreement is subject to the risk that certain occurrences, such as particular restructuring
events affecting the value of the underlying reference debt obligation, or the restructuring of sovereign debt, may not be deemed
credit events under the credit default swap agreement. Therefore, if the credit default swap was purchased as a hedge or to take
advantage of an anticipated increase in the value of credit protection for the underlying reference obligation, it may not provide
any hedging benefit or otherwise increase in value as anticipated. Similarly, the seller of protection in a credit default swap
agreement is subject to the risk that certain occurrences may be deemed to be credit events under the credit default swap agreement,
even if these occurrences do not adversely impact the value or creditworthiness of the underlying reference debt obligation.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify"><I>Interest rate swaps</I>. An interest
rate swap is an agreement between two parties to exchange interest rate payment obligations. Typically, one party&rsquo;s obligation
is based on an interest rate fixed to maturity while the other party&rsquo;s obligation is based on an interest rate that changes
in accordance with changes in a designated benchmark (for example, SOFR, prime rate, commercial paper rate, or other benchmarks).
Alternatively, both payment obligations may be based on an interest rate that changes in accordance with changes in a designated
benchmark (also known as a &ldquo;basis swap&rdquo;). In a basis swap, the rates may be based on different benchmarks (for example,
SOFR versus commercial paper) or on different terms of the same benchmark (for example, one-month SOFR versus three-month SOFR).
Each party&rsquo;s payment obligation under an interest rate swap is determined by reference to a specified &ldquo;notional&rdquo;
amount of money. Therefore, interest rate swaps generally do not involve the delivery of securities, other underlying instruments,
or principal amounts; rather they entail the exchange of cash payments based on the application of the designated interest rates
to the notional amount. Accordingly, barring swap counterparty or FCM default, the risk of loss in an interest rate swap is limited
to the net amount of interest payments that an Underlying ETF is obligated to make or receive (as applicable), as well as any early
termination payment payable by or to such Underlying ETF upon early termination of the swap.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">By swapping fixed interest rate payments
for floating payments, an interest rate swap can be used to increase or decrease an Underlying ETF&rsquo;s exposure to various
interest rates, including to hedge interest rate risk. Interest rate swaps are generally used to permit the party seeking a floating
rate obligation the opportunity to acquire such obligation at a rate lower than is directly available in the credit markets, while
permitting the party desiring a fixed-rate obligation the opportunity to acquire such a fixed-rate obligation, also frequently
at a rate lower than is directly available in the credit markets. The success of such a transaction depends in large part on the
availability of fixed-rate obligations at interest (or coupon) rates low enough to cover the costs involved. Similarly, a basis
swap can be used to increase or decrease an Underlying ETF&rsquo;s exposure to various interest rates, including to hedge against
or speculate on the spread between the two indexes, or to manage duration. An interest rate swap transaction is affected by change
in interest rates, which, in turn, may affect the prepayment rate of any underlying debt obligations upon which the interest rate
swap is based.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify"><I>Inflation index swaps</I>. An inflation
index swap is a contract between two parties, whereby one party makes payments based on the cumulative percentage increase in an
index that serves as a measure of inflation (typically, the Consumer Price Index) and the other party makes a regular payment based
on a compounded fixed rate. Each party&rsquo;s payment obligation under the swap is determined by reference to a specified &ldquo;notional&rdquo;
amount of money. Typically, an inflation index swap has payment obligations netted and exchanged upon maturity. The value of an
inflation index swap is expected to change in response to changes in the rate of inflation. If inflation increases at a faster
rate than anticipated at the time the swap is entered into, the swap will increase in value. Similarly, if inflation increases
at a rate slower than anticipated at the time the swap is entered into, the swap will decrease in value.</P>

to an equity security or basket of equity securities) is an agreement between two parties under which the parties agree to make
payments to each other so as to replicate the economic consequences that would apply had a purchase or short sale of the underlying
reference instrument or index thereof taken place. For example, one party agrees to pay the other party the total return earned
or realized on the notional amount of an underlying equity security and any dividends declared with respect to that equity security.

or to extend, terminate or otherwise modify the terms of an existing swap agreement. The writer (seller) of an option on a swap

secondary market will exist for any particular option on a swap agreement, or at any particular time, and an Underlying ETF may
have difficulty affecting closing transactions in particular options on swap agreements. Therefore, such Underlying ETF may have
to exercise the options that it purchases in order to realize any profit and take delivery of the underlying swap agreement. The
Fund could then incur transaction costs upon the sale or closing out of the underlying swap agreement. In the event that the option
on a swap is exercised, the counterparty for such option would be the same counterparty with whom the Fund entered into the underlying

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">An option on an interest rate swap (also
sometimes referred to as a &ldquo;swaption&rdquo;) is a contract that gives the purchaser the right, but not the obligation, in
return for payment of a premium, to enter into a new interest rate swap. A pay fixed option on an interest rate swap gives the
buyer the right to establish a position in an interest rate swap where the buyer will pay (and the writer will receive) the fixed-rate
cash flows and receive (and the writer will pay) the floating-rate cash flows. In general, most options on interest rate swaps
are &ldquo;European&rdquo; exercise, which means that they can only be exercised at the end of the option term. Depending on the
movement of interest rates between the time of purchase and expiration, the value of the underlying interest rate swap and therefore
also the value of the option on the interest rate swap will change.</P>

contract that gives the buyer the right (but not the obligation), in return for payment of a premium to the option seller, to enter
into a new credit default swap on a reference entity at a predetermined spread on a future date. This spread is the price at which
the contract is executed (the option strike price). Similar to a put option, in a payer option on a credit default swap, the option
buyer pays a premium to the option seller for the right, but not the obligation, to buy credit protection on a reference entity
(e.g., a particular portfolio security) at a predetermined spread on a future date. Similar to a call option, in a receiver option
on a credit default swap the option buyer pays a premium for the right, but not the obligation to sell credit default swap protection
on a reference entity or index. Depending on the movement of market spreads with respect to the particular referenced debt securities
between the time of purchase and expiration of the option, the value of the underlying credit default swap and therefore the value
of the option will change. Options on credit default swaps currently are traded OTC and the specific terms of each option on a

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify"><I>Commodity-linked total return swaps</I>.
A commodity-linked total return swap is an agreement between two parties under which the parties agree to exchange a fixed return
or interest rate on the notional amount of the swap for the return of a particular commodities index, commodity contract or basket
of commodity contracts as if such notional amount had been invested in such index, commodity contract or basket of commodity contracts.
For example, one party agrees to pay the other party the return on a particular index multiplied by the notional amount of the
swap. In return, the other party makes periodic payments, such as at a floating interest rate, calculated based on such notional
amount. If the commodity swap is for one period, an Underlying ETF may pay a fixed fee, established at the outset of the swap.
However, if the term of the commodity swap is more than one period, with interim swap payments, an Underlying ETF may pay an adjustable
or floating fee. With a &ldquo;floating&rdquo; rate, the fee may be pegged to a base rate, such as the SOFR, and is adjusted each
period. Therefore, if interest rates increase over the term of the swap contract, an Underlying ETF may be required to pay a higher
fee at each swap reset date.</P>

of swap transactions is a highly specialized activity, which involves investment techniques and risks different from those associated
with ordinary portfolio securities transactions. Whether the Underlying ETFs will be successful in using swap agreements to achieve
its investment goal depends on the ability of the Sub-Adviser correctly to predict which types of investments are likely to produce
greater returns. If the Sub-Adviser, in using swap agreements, is incorrect in its forecasts of market values, interest rates,
inflation, currency exchange rates or other applicable factors, the investment performance of an Underlying ETF will be less than
its performance would have been if it had not used the swap agreements.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">The risk of loss to an Underlying ETF for
swap transactions that are entered into on a net basis depends on which party is obligated to pay the net amount to the other party.
If the counterparty is obligated to pay the net amount to an Underlying ETF, the risk of loss to the Fund is loss of the entire
amount that the Fund is entitled to receive. If an Underlying ETF is obligated to pay the net amount, the Fund&rsquo;s risk of
loss is generally limited to that net amount. If the swap agreement involves the exchange of the entire principal value of a security,
the entire principal value of that security is subject to the risk that the other party to the swap will default on its contractual
delivery obligations. In addition, an Underlying ETF&rsquo;s risk of loss also includes any margin at risk in the event of default
by the counterparty (in an uncleared swap) or the central counterparty or FCM (in a cleared swap), plus any transaction costs.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">Because bilateral swap agreements are structured
as two-party contracts and may have terms of greater than seven days, these swaps may be considered to be illiquid and, therefore,
subject to an Underlying ETF&rsquo;s limitation on investments in illiquid securities. If a swap transaction is particularly large
or if the relevant market is illiquid, the Fund may not be able to establish or liquidate a position at an advantageous time or
price, which may result in significant losses. Participants in the swap markets are not required to make continuous markets in
the swap contracts they trade. Participants could refuse to quote prices for swap contracts or quote prices with an unusually widespread
between the price at which they are prepared to buy and the price at which they are prepared to sell. Some swap agreements entail
complex terms and may require a greater degree of subjectivity in their valuation. However, the swap markets have grown substantially
in recent years, with a large number of financial institutions acting both as principals and agents, utilizing standardized swap
documentation. As a result, the swap markets have become increasingly liquid. In addition, central clearing and the trading of
cleared swaps on public facilities are intended to increase liquidity. The Adviser, under the supervision of the Board, is responsible
for determining and monitoring the liquidity of the Underlying ETFs&rsquo; swap transactions.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify"><I>Risks of uncleared swaps</I>. Uncleared
swaps are typically executed bilaterally with a swap dealer rather than traded on exchanges. As a result, swap participants may
not be as protected as participants on organized exchanges. Performance of a swap agreement is the responsibility only of the swap
counterparty and not of any exchange or clearinghouse. As a result, an Underlying ETF is subject to the risk that a counterparty
will be unable or will refuse to perform under such agreement, including because of the counterparty&rsquo;s bankruptcy or insolvency.
An Underlying ETF risks the loss of the accrued but unpaid amounts under a swap agreement, which could be substantial, in the event
of a default, insolvency or bankruptcy by a swap counterparty. In such an event, the Fund will have contractual remedies pursuant
to the swap agreements, but bankruptcy and insolvency laws could affect such Underlying ETF&rsquo;s rights as a creditor. If the
counterparty&rsquo;s creditworthiness declines, the value of a swap agreement would likely decline, potentially resulting in losses.
In unusual or extreme market conditions, a counterparty&rsquo;s creditworthiness and ability to perform may deteriorate rapidly,
and the availability of suitable replacement counterparties may become limited.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify"><I>Risks of cleared swaps</I>. As noted
above, under recent financial reforms, certain types of swaps are, and others eventually are expected to be, required to be cleared
through a central counterparty, which may affect counterparty risk and other risks faced by the Underlying ETFs.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">Central clearing is designed to reduce
counterparty credit risk and increase liquidity compared to uncleared swaps because central clearing interposes the central clearinghouse
as the counterparty to each participant&rsquo;s swap, but it does not eliminate those risks completely. There is also a risk of
loss by an Underlying ETF of the initial and variation margin deposits in the event of bankruptcy of the FCM with which the Fund
has an open position, or the central counterparty in a swap contract. The assets of an Underlying ETF may not be fully protected
in the event of the bankruptcy of the FCM or central counterparty because the Fund might be limited to recovering only a pro rata
share of all available funds and margin segregated on behalf of an FCM&rsquo;s customers. If the FCM does not provide accurate
reporting, the Underlying ETFs are also subject to the risk that the FCM could use such Underlying ETF&rsquo;s assets, which are
held in an omnibus account with assets belonging to the FCM&rsquo;s other customers, to satisfy its own financial obligations or
the payment obligations of another customer to the central counterparty. Credit risk of cleared swap participants is concentrated
in a few clearinghouses, and the consequences of insolvency of a clearinghouse are not clear.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">With cleared swaps, an Underlying ETF may
not be able to obtain as favorable terms as it would be able to negotiate for a bilateral, uncleared swap. In addition, an FCM
may unilaterally amend the terms of its agreement with an Underlying ETF, which may include the imposition of position limits or
additional margin requirements with respect to the Fund&rsquo;s investment in certain types of swaps. Central counterparties and
FCMs can require termination of existing cleared swap transactions upon the occurrence of certain events, and can also require
increases in margin above the margin that is required at the initiation of the swap agreement.</P>

to clear the transaction. In such an event, an Underlying ETF may be required to break the trade and make an early termination
payment to the executing broker.</P>

the payment of principal and interest upon a default by the issuer of its principal and interest payment obligations. They are
usually paid from general revenues of the issuing governmental entity. Revenue bonds, on the other hand, are usually payable only
out of a specific revenue source rather than from general revenues. Revenue bonds ordinarily are not backed by the faith, credit
or general taxing power of the issuing governmental entity. The principal and interest on revenue bonds for private facilities
are typically paid out of rents or other specified payments made to the issuing governmental entity by a private company&nbsp;which
uses or operates the facilities. Examples of these types of obligations are industrial revenue bond and pollution control revenue
bonds. Industrial revenue bonds are issued by governmental entities to provide financing aid to community facilities such as hospitals,
hotels, business or residential complexes, convention halls and sport complexes. Pollution control revenue bonds are issued to
finance air, water and solids pollution control systems for privately operated industrial or commercial facilities.</P>

bonds for private facilities usually do not represent a pledge of the credit, general revenues or taxing powers&nbsp;of issuing
governmental entity. Instead, the private company operating the facility is the sole source of payment of the obligation. Sometimes,
the funds for payment of revenue bonds come solely from revenue generated by operation of the facility. Federal income tax laws
place substantial limitations on industrial revenue bonds, and particularly certain specified private activity bonds issued after
August 7, 1986. In the future, legislation could be introduced in Congress which could further restrict or eliminate the income
tax exemption for interest on debt obligations in which the Fund may invest.</P>

leases and installment purchase or conditional sales contracts (which usually provide for title to the leased&nbsp;asset to pass
to the governmental issuer upon payment of all amounts due under the contract) have evolved as a means for governmental issuers
to acquire property and equipment without meeting the constitutional and statutory requirements for the issuance of municipal debt.
The debt issuance limitations are deemed to be inapplicable because of the inclusion in many leases and contracts of &ldquo;non-appropriation&rdquo;
clauses that provide that the governmental issuer has no obligation to make future payments under the lease or contract unless
money is appropriated for this purpose by the appropriate legislative body on a yearly or other periodic basis. Although these
kinds of obligations are secured by the leased equipment or facilities, the disposition of the pledged property in the event of
non-appropriation or foreclosure might, in some cases, prove difficult and time consuming. In addition, disposition upon non-appropriation
or foreclosure might not result in recovery by an Underlying ETF of the full principal amount represented by an obligation.</P>

sufficient for paying the bondholders. The escrow fund for a pre-refunded municipal bond may be structured so that the refunded
bonds are to be called at the first possible date or a subsequent call date established in the original bond debenture. The call
price usually includes a premium from 1% to 3% above par. This type of structure usually is used for those refundings that either
reduce the issuer&rsquo;s interest payment expenses or change the debt maturity schedule. In escrow funds for ETM refunded municipal

exposure to the underlying security. When short-term interest rates rise or fall, the interest payable on&nbsp;the Floaters issued
by a TOB Trust will, respectively, rise or fall,&nbsp;leaving&nbsp;less or more, respectively, residual interest cash flow from
the underlying security available for payment on the Inverse Floaters. Thus, as short-term interest rates rise,&nbsp;Inverse Floaters
produce less income for an Underlying ETF, and as short-term interest rates decline, Inverse Floaters produce more income for the
Fund. The price of Inverse Floaters is expected to decline when interest rates rise and increase when interest rates decline, in
either case generally more so than the price of a bond with a similar maturity, because of the effect of leverage. As a result,
the price of Inverse Floaters is typically more volatile than the price of bonds with similar maturities, especially if the relevant
TOB Trust is structured to provide the holder of the Inverse Floaters relatively greater leveraged exposure to the underlying security
(e.g., if the par amount of the Floaters, as a percentage of the par amount of the underlying security, is relatively greater).
Upon the occurrence of certain adverse events (including a credit ratings downgrade of the underlying security or a substantial
decrease in the market&nbsp;value of the underlying security), a TOB Trust may be collapsed by the remarketing agent or liquidity
provider and the underlying security liquidated, and an Underlying ETF could lose the entire amount of its investment in the Inverse
Floater and may,&nbsp;in some cases,&nbsp;be contractually required to pay the shortfall,&nbsp;if any,&nbsp;between the liquidation
value of the underlying security and the principal amount of the Floaters. Consequently, in a rising interest rate environment,
an Underlying ETF&rsquo;s investments in Inverse Floaters could negatively impact the Fund&rsquo;s performance and yield, especially
when those Inverse Floaters provide the Fund with relatively greater&nbsp;leveraged exposure to the underlying securities held
by the relevant TOB Trusts.</P>

a litigation settlement agreement reached out of court in November 1998 between 46 states and six other U.S. jurisdictions and
the four largest U.S. tobacco manufacturers at that time. Subsequently, a number of smaller tobacco manufacturers signed on to
the MSA, which provides for annual payments by the manufacturers to the states and other jurisdictions in perpetuity. The MSA established
a base payment schedule and a formula for adjusting payments each year. Tobacco manufacturers pay into a master escrow trust based
on their market share and each state receives a fixed percentage of the payment.</P>

the future flow of those payments by selling bonds, some through&nbsp;distinct governmental entities created for such purpose.
The bonds are backed by the future revenue flows from the tobacco manufacturers. Annual payments on the bonds, and thus the risk

on many factors including, but not limited to, annual domestic cigarette shipments, cigarette&nbsp;consumption, inflation and the
financial capability of participating tobacco companies. As a result, payments made by tobacco manufacturers could be reduced if
the decrease in tobacco consumption is significantly greater than the forecasted decline. A market share loss by the MSA companies
to non-MSA participating tobacco manufacturers could also cause a downward adjustment in the payment amounts. A participating manufacturer
filing for bankruptcy also could cause delays or reductions in bond payments, which could affect the Fund&rsquo;s net asset value.</P>

the FDA to adopt product standards for tobacco products, restrict advertising of tobacco products, and impose stricter warning

On August 31, 2009, a number of tobacco manufacturers filed suit in federal court in Kentucky alleging that certain of the provisions

obligation debt in that general obligation debt is backed by the state&rsquo;s full faith, credit and taxing power, while appropriation
debt requires the state to pass a specific periodic appropriation to pay interest and/or principal on the bonds as the payments
come due. The appropriation is usually made annually. While STA Tobacco Bonds offer an enhanced credit support feature, that feature
is generally not an unconditional guarantee of payment by a state and states generally do not pledge the full faith, credit or

Mortgages may have fixed or adjustable interest rates. Interests in pools of adjustable rate mortgages are known as ARMs.&nbsp;Mortgage-backed
securities come in a variety of forms. Many have extremely complicated terms. The simplest form of mortgage-backed securities is
a &ldquo;pass-through certificate.&rdquo; Holders of pass-through certificates receive a pro rata share of the payments from the
underlying mortgages. Holders also receive a pro rata share of any prepayments, so they assume all the prepayment risk of the underlying
mortgages. Mortgage-backed securities tend to pay higher yields to compensate for prepayment risk.</P>

payments to another class (Principal Only or POs). POs increase in value when prepayment rates increase. In contrast, IOs decrease
in value when prepayments increase, because the underlying mortgages generate less interest payments. However, IOs&rsquo; prices
tend to increase when interest rates rise (and prepayments fall), making IOs a useful hedge against market risk.</P>

prepayment of the mortgages underlying residential mortgage-backed securities, which deprives holders of the securities of the

preferred stock, convertible bonds or debentures, units consisting of &ldquo;usable&rdquo; bonds and warrants or a combination
of the features of several of these securities. The investment characteristics of each convertible security vary widely, which

Securities</I>. Zero-coupon securities make no periodic interest payments, but are sold at a deep discount from their face value.
The buyer recognizes a rate of return determined by the gradual appreciation of the security, which is redeemed at face value on
a specified maturity date. The discount varies depending on the time remaining until maturity, as well as market interest rates,
liquidity of the security, and the issuer&rsquo;s perceived credit quality. If the issuer defaults, the holder may not receive
any return on its investment. Because zero-coupon securities bear no interest, their price fluctuates more than other types of
bonds. Since zero-coupon bondholders do not receive interest payments, when interest rates rise, zero-coupon securities fall more
dramatically in value than bonds paying interest on a current basis. When interest rates fall, zero-coupon securities rise more
rapidly in value because the bonds reflect a fixed rate of return. An investment in zero-coupon may cause an Underlying ETF to
recognize income and make distributions to shareholders before it receives any cash payments on its investment. Pay-in-kind securities
have characteristics similar to those of zero coupon securities, but interest on such securities may be paid in the form of obligations
of the same type rather than cash.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; background-color: white">There is less
publicly available, reliable information about most bank loans than is the case for many other types of debt instruments. In certain
circumstances, these loans may not be deemed to be securities and bank loans are not subject to many of the rules governing the
securities markets, including disclosure requirements. As a result, bank loan investors may not have the protection of the anti-fraud
provision of the federal securities laws, and must rely instead on the contractual provisions in the loan agreement and applicable
common-law fraud protections. Traditionally, borrowers under bank loans make non-public information available to their lenders.
However, as the universe of bank loan market participants has expanded beyond traditional lenders to include dealers, funds, and
other investors who are active in the public securities markets, some participants choose not to receive such non-public information
and make investment decisions based solely on public information about the borrower. If an Underlying ETF purchases a bank loan
and elects not to receive non-public information with respect to the loan, it may forego information that would be relevant to
its investment decisions.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify; background-color: white">An economic downturn
generally leads to a higher non-payment rate for bank loans, and a loan may lose significant value before a default occurs. Moreover,
any specific collateral used to secure a loan may decline in value or become illiquid, which would adversely affect the loan&rsquo;s
value. In the event of the bankruptcy of a borrower, an Underlying ETF could experience delays or limitations with respect to its
ability to realize the benefits of the collateral securing a loan. No active trading market may exist for certain loans, which
may impair the ability of a fund to realize full value in the event of the need to sell a loan and which may make it difficult
to value loans. Adverse market conditions may impair the liquidity of some actively traded loans. To the extent that a secondary
market does exist for certain loans, the market may be subject to irregular trading activity and wide bid/ask spreads, which may
result in limited liquidity and pricing transparency. In addition, loans may be subject to restrictions on sales or assignment
and generally are subject to extended settlement periods that may be longer than seven days.</P>

be able to unilaterally enforce all rights and remedies under a bank loan and with regard to any associated collateral. If a bank
loan is acquired through a participation, an Underlying ETF generally will have no right to enforce compliance by the borrower
with the terms of the loan agreement, and an Underlying ETF may not directly benefit from the collateral supporting the debt obligation
in which it has purchased the participation. As a result, each Fund will be exposed to the credit risk of both the borrower and
the institution selling the participation.</P>

in second-lien loans, which are subordinated to claims of senior secured creditors. Because second-lien loans are subordinated
or unsecured and thus lower in priority of payment to senior loans, they are typically lower rated and subject to the additional
risk that the cash flow of the borrower and property securing the loan or debt, if any, may be insufficient to meet scheduled payments
after giving effect to the senior secured obligations of the borrower. Second-lien loans generally have greater price volatility
than senior loans and may be less liquid.</P>

interest rate adjustment index as provided in the respective obligations. The adjustment intervals may be regular, and range from
daily up to annually, or may be event based, such as based on a change in the base rate. The base rate usually is a benchmark that
&ldquo;floats&rdquo; or changes to reflect current interest rates, such as the prime rate offered by one or more major U.S. banks.
The applicable benchmark is defined by the terms of an obligation and will remain the same for the life of such obligation. If
the benchmark interest rate on a floating rate security changes, the rate payable will, in turn, change at the next scheduled adjustment

Underlying ETF, subject to its investment strategies and policies, </FONT>may invest in a TBA securities transaction, which is
a type of forward-commitment transaction, represents an agreement to buy or sell mortgage-backed securities with agreed-upon characteristics
for a fixed unit price, with settlement on a scheduled future date, typically within 30 calendar days of the trade date. With TBA
transactions, the particular securities (i.e., specified mortgage pools) to be delivered or received are not identified at the
trade date; however, securities delivered to a purchaser must meet specified criteria, including face value, coupon rate, and maturity,
and be within industry- accepted &ldquo;good delivery&rdquo; standards. The Fund may sell TBA securities to hedge its portfolio
positions or to dispose of mortgage-backed securities it owns under delayed-delivery arrangements. Proceeds of TBA securities sold
are not received until the contractual settlement date. For TBA purchases, an Underlying ETF may be required to post sufficient
liquid assets (e.g., cash or marketable securities) until settlement date with a qualified custodian as collateral in an amount
sufficient to meet the purchase price. Unsettled TBA securities are valued by an independent pricing service based on the characteristics
of the securities to be delivered or received. A risk associated with TBA transactions is that at settlement, either the buyer
fails to pay the agreed price for the securities, or the seller fails to deliver the agreed securities. As the value of such unsettled
TBA securities is assessed on a daily basis, parties mitigate such risk by, among other things, exchanging collateral as security
for performance, performing a credit analysis of the counterparty, allocating transactions among numerous counterparties, and monitoring
its exposure to each counterparty.</P>

Underlying ETF, subject to its investment strategies and policies, </FONT>may invest in REITs. A U.S. REIT is a corporation or
business trust (that would otherwise be taxed as a corporation) which meets the definitional requirements of the Code. The Code
permits a qualifying REIT to deduct from taxable income the dividends paid, thereby effectively eliminating corporate level federal
income tax. To meet the definitional requirements of the Code, a REIT must, among other things: invest substantially all of its
assets in interests in real estate (including mortgages and other REITs), cash and government securities; derive most of its income
from rents from real property or interest on loans secured by mortgages on real property; and, in general, distribute annually
90% or more of its taxable income (other than net capital gains) to shareholders.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">REITs are sometimes informally characterized
as Equity REITs and Mortgage REITs. An Equity REIT invests primarily in the fee ownership or leasehold ownership of land and buildings

which may secure construction, development or long-term loans.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">REITs may be affected by changes in underlying
real estate values, which may have an exaggerated effect to the extent that REITs in which an Underlying ETF invests may concentrate
investments in particular geographic regions or property types. Additionally, rising interest rates may cause investors in REITs
to demand a higher annual yield from future distributions, which may in turn decrease market prices for equity securities issued
by REITs. Rising interest rates also generally increase the costs of obtaining financing, which could cause the value of an Underlying
ETF&rsquo;s investments to decline. During periods of declining interest rates, certain Mortgage REITs may hold mortgages that
the mortgagors elect to prepay, which prepayment may diminish the yield on securities issued by such Mortgage REITs. In addition,
Mortgage REITs may be affected by the ability of borrowers to repay when due the debt extended by the REIT and Equity REITs may
be affected by the ability of tenants to pay rent.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">Certain REITs have relatively small market
capitalization, which may tend to increase the volatility of the market price of securities issued by such REITs. Furthermore,
REITs are dependent upon specialized management skills, have limited diversification and are, therefore, subject to risks inherent
in operating and financing a limited number of projects. By investing in REITs indirectly through an Underlying ETF, a shareholder
will bear not only his or her proportionate share of the expenses of the Underlying ETFs, but also, indirectly, similar expenses
of the REITs. REITs depend generally on their ability to generate cash flow to make distributions to shareholders.</P>

the quality of any credit extended. Further, Equity and Mortgage REITs are dependent upon management skills and generally may not
be diversified. Equity and Mortgage REITs are also subject to heavy cash flow dependency defaults by borrowers and self-liquidation.
In addition, Equity and Mortgage REITs could possibly fail to qualify for the favorable U.S. federal income tax treatment generally
available to REITs under the Code or fail to maintain their exemptions from registration under the 1940 Act. The above factors
may also adversely affect a borrower&rsquo;s or a lessee&rsquo;s ability to meet its obligations to the REIT. In the event of default
by a borrower or lessee, the REIT may experience delays in enforcing its rights as a mortgagee or lessor and may incur substantial
costs associated with protecting its investments.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">MLPs are generally treated as partnerships
for U.S. federal income tax purposes. When an Underlying ETF invests in the equity securities of a MLP or any other entity that
is treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Underlying ETFs will be treated as a partner in the entity
for tax purposes. Accordingly, in calculating an Underlying ETF&rsquo;s taxable income, it will be required to take into account
its allocable share of the income, gains, losses, deductions, and credits recognized by each such entity, regardless of whether
the entity distributes cash to the Underlying ETFs. Distributions from such an entity to an Underlying ETF are not generally taxable
unless the cash amount (or, in certain cases, the fair market value of marketable securities) distributed to the Underlying ETFs
exceeds the Underlying ETF&rsquo;s adjusted tax basis in its interest in the entity. In general, an Underlying ETF&rsquo;s allocable
share of such an entity&rsquo;s net income will increase the Underlying ETF&rsquo;s adjusted tax basis in its interest in the entity,
and distributions to the Underlying ETFs from such an entity and the Underlying ETF&rsquo;s allocable share of the entity&rsquo;s
net losses will decrease the Underlying ETF&rsquo;s adjusted basis in its interest in the entity, but not below zero. The Underlying
ETF may receive cash distributions from such an entity in excess of the net amount of taxable income the Underlying ETFs is allocated
from its investment in the entity. In other circumstances, the net amount of taxable income an Underlying ETF is allocated from
its investment in such an entity may exceed cash distributions received from the entity. Thus, an Underlying ETF&rsquo;s investments
in such an entity may lead the Underlying ETFs to make distributions in excess of its earnings and profits, or the Underlying ETFs
may be required to sell investments, including when not otherwise advantageous to do so, to satisfy the distribution requirements
applicable to RICs under the Code.</P>

passed through to an Underlying ETF from any investments in MLPs in a given year will generally reduce the Underlying ETF&rsquo;s

recognized and distributed, recapture income will generally be taxable to an Underlying ETF&rsquo;s shareholders at the time of

announced a federal takeover of the FNMA and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (&ldquo;Freddie Mac&rdquo;), placing the
two federal instrumentalities in conservatorship. Under the takeover, the U.S. Treasury agreed to acquire $1 billion of senior
preferred stock of each instrumentality and obtained warrants for the purchase of common stock of each instrumentality (the &ldquo;Senior
Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement&rdquo; or &ldquo;Agreement&rdquo;). Under the Agreement, the U.S. Treasury pledged to provide
up to $200 billion per instrumentality as needed, including the contribution of cash capital to the instrumentalities in the event
their liabilities exceed their assets. This was intended to ensure that the instrumentalities maintain a positive net worth and
meet their financial obligations, preventing mandatory triggering of receivership. As a result of this Agreement, the investments
of holders, including the Fund, of mortgage-backed securities and other obligations issued by the FNMA and Freddie Mac are protected.&nbsp;</P>

amended the Agreement to allow the $200 billion cap on the U.S. Treasury&rsquo;s funding commitment to increase as necessary to
accommodate any cumulative reduction in net worth over the next three years. On August 17, 2012, the U.S. Treasury announced the
Third Amendment to the Agreement that recalibrated the calculation of the quarterly dividends that Freddie Mac pays to the U.S.
Treasury which eliminated the need for Freddie Mac circularly to borrow from the U.S. Treasury only then to pay dividends back
to the U.S. Treasury. The Third Amendment suspended the periodic commitment fee for so long as the dividend amounts were based
on net worth. The Third Amendment also eliminated the requirement that Freddie Mac obtain the U.S. Treasury&rsquo;s consent for
asset dispositions with a fair market value (individually or in aggregate) of less than $250 million, but required Freddie Mac
to submit annual risk management plans to the U.S. Treasury. On December 21, 2017, a letter agreement between the U.S. Treasury
and Freddie Mac changed the terms of the senior preferred stock certificates to permit Freddie Mac to retain a $3 billion capital
reserve, quarterly. On September 30, 2019, the U.S. Treasury and the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA), acting as Conservator
to Freddie Mac, announced amendments to the senior preferred stock certificates that will permit Freddie Mac to retain earnings
beyond the $3 billion capital reserves previously allowed through the letter agreements. Since January 6, 2014, FHFA has conducted
an ongoing assessment of its obligations and statutory mandates in preparation for Freddie Mac&rsquo;s eventual exit from conservatorship.&nbsp;</P>

may be issued by the U.S. Government, its agencies or instrumentalities, and may also be issued by private originators or investors,
including depository institutions, banks, investment banks and special purpose subsidiaries of these entities. Strips&nbsp;are
usually structured with classes that receive different proportions of the interest and principal distributions from an underlying
asset or pool of underlying assets.&nbsp;Strips&nbsp;are particularly sensitive to changes in interest rates, which may impact
the frequency of principal payments (including prepayments) on the underlying assets or pool of underlying assets. Some structures
may have a class that receives only interest from the underlying assets, an interest-only (&ldquo;IO&rdquo;) class, while another
class may receive only principal, a principal-only (&ldquo;PO&rdquo;) class. IO and PO&nbsp;Strips&nbsp;may be purchased for their
return and/or hedging characteristics. Because of their structure, IO&nbsp;Strips&nbsp;may move differently than typical fixed-income
securities in relation to changes in interest rates. IO&nbsp;Strips&nbsp;tend to decrease in value if prepayments are greater than
anticipated and increase in value if prepayments are less than anticipated. Conversely, PO&nbsp;Strips&nbsp;tend to increase in
value if prepayments are greater than anticipated and decline if prepayments are less than anticipated. While the U.S. Government
or its agencies or instrumentalities may guarantee the full repayment of principal on&nbsp;Strips&nbsp;they issue, repayment of
interest is guaranteed only while the underlying assets or pools of assets are outstanding. To the extent the Fund invests in&nbsp;Strips,
rapid changes in the rate of prepayments may have an adverse effect on the Fund&rsquo;s performance. In addition, the secondary
market for&nbsp;Strips&nbsp;may be less liquid than that for other securities. Certain&nbsp;Strips&nbsp;may also present certain
operational and/or valuation risks.</P>

ETF, subject to its investment strategies and policies, may invest in preferred stocks or fixed-income securities which are convertible
into common stock. Convertible securities are securities that may be converted either at a stated price or rate within a specified
period of time into a specified number of shares of common stock. Traditionally, convertible securities have paid dividends or
interest greater than on the related common stocks, but less than fixed income non-convertible securities. By investing in a convertible
security, an Underlying ETF may participate in any capital appreciation or depreciation of a company&rsquo;s stock, but to a lesser
degree than if it had invested in that company&rsquo;s common stock. Convertible securities rank senior to common stock in a corporation&rsquo;s
capital structure and, therefore, entail less risk than the corporation&rsquo;s common stock. The value of a convertible security
is a function of its &ldquo;investment value&rdquo; (its value as if it did not have a conversion privilege), and its &ldquo;conversion
value&rdquo; (the security&rsquo;s worth if it were to be exchanged for the underlying security, at market value, pursuant to its
conversion privilege). An Underlying ETF may attempt to hedge certain of its investments in convertible debt securities by selling
short the issuer&rsquo;s common stock.</P>

which is restricted under the federal securities laws), investments that may only be resold pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities
Act, but that are deemed to be illiquid; and repurchase agreements with maturities in excess of seven days. However, no Fund will
acquire illiquid investments if, immediately after the acquisition, such investments would comprise more than 15% of the value
of such Underlying ETF&rsquo;s net assets. Determinations of liquidity are made pursuant to guidelines contained in the liquidity
risk management program applicable to each Underlying ETF. The relevant ETF&rsquo;s investment adviser typically determines and
monitors the liquidity of the portfolio investments and reports periodically on its decisions to the Board. In making such determinations
it takes into account a number of factors in reaching liquidity decisions, including but not limited to: (1) the frequency of trades
and quotations for the security; (2) the number of dealers willing to purchase or sell the security and the number of other potential
buyers; (3) the willingness of dealers to undertake to make a market in the security; and (4) the nature of the marketplace trades,
including the time needed to dispose of the security, the method of soliciting offers and the mechanics of the transfer. The term
&ldquo;illiquid security&rdquo; is defined as a security that an Underlying ETF reasonably expects cannot be sold or disposed of
in current market conditions in seven calendar days or less without the sale or disposition significantly changing the market value
of the security.&nbsp;</P>

and a considerable period may elapse between the time of the decision to sell and the time such Underlying ETF may be permitted
to sell a security under an effective registration statement. If, during such a period, adverse market conditions were to develop,
an Underlying ETF might obtain a less favorable price than that which prevailed when it decided to sell.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">An Underlying ETF, subject to its investment
strategies and policies, may take short positions in securities and financial instruments expected to decline in price. To effect
a short sale, an Underlying ETF arranges through a broker to borrow the security it does not own to be delivered to a buyer of
such security. In borrowing the security to be delivered to the buyer, an Underlying ETF will become obligated to replace the security
borrowed at the time of replacement, regardless of the market price at that time. A short sale results in a gain when the price
of the securities sold short declines between the date of the short sale and the date on which a security is purchased to replace
the borrowed security. Conversely, a short sale will result in a loss if the price of the security sold short increases. When an
Underlying ETF makes a short sale, the broker effecting the short sale typically holds the proceeds as part of the collateral securing
an Underlying ETF&rsquo;s obligation to cover the short position. Short sales may involve substantial risk and leverage.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">An Underlying ETF will suffer a loss if
it sells a security short and the value of the security rises rather than falls. It is possible that an Underlying ETF&rsquo;s
long positions will decline in value at the same time that the value of its short positions increase, thereby increasing potential
losses to an Underlying ETF. Short sales expose an Underlying ETF to the risk that it will be required to buy the security sold
short (also known as &ldquo;covering&rdquo; the short position) at a time when the security has appreciated in value, thus resulting
in a loss to an Underlying ETF. In addition, an Underlying ETF may be subject to expenses related to short sales that are not typically
associated with investing in securities directly, such as costs of borrowing, which may negatively impact performance. Short positions
introduce more risk to an Underlying ETF than long positions (purchases) because the maximum sustainable loss on a security purchased
(held long) is limited to the amount paid for the security plus the transaction costs, whereas there is no maximum attainable price
of the shorted security. Therefore, in theory, securities sold short have unlimited risk.</P>

as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code and be eligible to receive &ldquo;pass-through&rdquo; tax treatment, an Underlying ETF
must, among other things, meet certain requirements regarding the source of its income, the diversification of its assets and the

income,&rdquo; which generally consists of dividends, interest, gains on investment assets and certain other categories of investment
income (also referred to as &ldquo;good income&rdquo;). Qualifying income generally does not include income derived from futures
contracts. When a RIC is a &ldquo;U.S. Shareholder&rdquo; of certain foreign subsidiaries (&ldquo;controlled foreign corporations&rdquo;

is distributed by the CFC. Under final Treasury Regulations issued in 2019, both imputed and actual distributions from a CFC are
generally treated as qualifying income under the RIC source of income test. An Underlying ETF&rsquo;s investment in its Subsidiary
is intended to provide the Underlying ETF with exposure to futures contracts within the limitations of the Code such that the Underlying

The policies underlying those private letter rulings would have been officially overturned if Treasury Regulations proposed on

F inclusions derived from the CFC (<I>i.e.,</I>&nbsp;deemed annual distributions from the CFC to the RIC, which the 2006 through

only actual distributions that the CFC makes to the RIC out of the CFC&rsquo;s earnings and profits for the applicable taxable
year that are attributable to the Subpart F inclusion (&ldquo;Earnings and Profits&rdquo;) would qualify. As discussed above, in
the Final Regulations, the Proposed Regulations were reversed with respect to this particular issue. Under the Final Regulations,
both actual and imputed distributions that the CFC makes to the RIC and Subpart F inclusions are generally treated as qualifying
income under the source of income test, provided that such income is derived with respect to the RIC&rsquo;s business of investing
in stock, securities or currencies. However, the Final Regulations do not specifically address distributions or Subpart F imputations
from CFCs that derive income from futures contracts. The Final Regulations do not clarify whether there are any limitations on
whether such income is qualifying income under the source of income test. The Final Regulations also do not expressly adopt or

cryptocurrency, operates on a decentralized network using blockchain technology to facilitate secure and anonymous transactions.
Bitcoin represents a digital asset that functions as a medium of exchange utilizing cryptographic protocols to secure transactional
processes, control the creation of additional units, and verify the transfer of assets. Its operation on a decentralized blockchain
network ensures both transparency and immutability of records, without the need for a central authority. This innovative technology
underpinning Bitcoin allows for peer-to-peer transactions and provides a framework for digital scarcity, making Bitcoin a unique

futures are relatively new investments and are subject to unique and substantial risks. The market for ether is subject to rapid
price swings, changes and uncertainty. Ether has been prone to rapid price declines, including significant declines occurring in
a single day, throughout its history. The further development of the Ethereum Network and the acceptance and use of ether are subject
to a variety of factors that are difficult to evaluate. The slowing, stopping or reversing of the development of the Ethereum Network
or the acceptance of ether may adversely affect the price and liquidity of ether. Ether is subject to the risk of fraud, theft,
manipulation or security failures, operational or other problems that impact ether trading venues. Additionally, if one or a coordinated
group of validators were to gain control of 33% or more of staked ether (i.e., ether that is deposited to support the Ethereum
Network), they would have the ability to execute extensive attacks, manipulate transactions and fraudulently obtain ether. If such
a validator or group of validators were to gain control of one-third of staked ether, they could halt payments. A significant portion
of ether is held by a small number of holders sometimes referred to as &ldquo;whales&rdquo;. Transactions by these holders may
influence the price of ether.</P>

As a result of the lack of regulation, individuals or groups may engage in fraud or market manipulation (including using social
media to promote ether in a way that artificially increases the price of ether). Investors may be more exposed to the risk of theft,
fraud and market manipulation than when investing in more traditional asset classes. Over the past&nbsp;several years, a number
of ether trading venues have been closed due to fraud, failure or security breaches. Investors in ether may have little or no recourse

returns may be different or lower than expected. Additionally, collateral requirements may require an Underlying ETF to liquidate

the availability of counterparties and other factors may impact the cost of ether futures contracts and decrease the correlation
between the performance of ether futures contracts and ether, over short or even long-term periods. In addition,&nbsp;the performance
of back-month futures contracts is likely to differ more significantly from the performance of the spot prices of ether. To the
extent an Underlying ETF is invested in back-month ether future contracts, the performance of that Underlying ETF should be expected
to deviate more significantly from the performance of ether.</P>

Futures Capacity Risk.</B>&nbsp;If an Underlying ETF&rsquo;s ability to obtain exposure to ether futures contracts consistent with

to the ether futures market, or as a result of margin requirements, position limits, accountability levels, or other limitations
imposed by the Underlying ETF&rsquo;s FCMs, the listing exchanges or the CFTC, the Underlying ETF may not be able to achieve its
investment objective and may experience significant losses.</P>

disruption in an Underlying ETF&rsquo;s ability to obtain exposure to ether futures contracts will cause the Underlying ETF&rsquo;s
performance to deviate from the performance of ether and ether futures. Additionally, the ability of an Underlying ETF to obtain
exposure to ether futures contracts is limited by certain tax rules that limit the amount the Underlying ETF can invest in its
wholly-owned subsidiary as of the end of each tax quarter. Exceeding this amount may have tax consequences.</P>

of Futures Investment Risk.</B>&nbsp;As discussed above, when an ether futures contract is nearing expiration, an Underlying ETF
will generally &ldquo;roll&rdquo; the futures contract, which means it will generally sell such contract and use the proceeds to
buy a ether futures contract with a later expiration date. When rolling futures contracts that are in contango, an Underlying ETF
would sell a lower priced, expiring contract and purchase a higher priced, longer-dated contract. The price difference between
the expiring contract and longer-dated contract associated with rolling ether futures is typically substantially higher than the
price difference associated with rolling other futures contracts. Ether futures have historically experienced extended periods
of contango. Contango in the ether futures market may have a significant adverse impact on the performance of an Underlying ETF
and may cause ether futures and the Fund to underperform spot ether. Both contango and backwardation would reduce the Underlying
ETF&rsquo;s correlation to spot ether and may limit or prevent it from achieving its investment objective. The impact of both contango
and backwardation may also be greater to the extent an Underlying ETF invests in back-month futures contracts.</P>

Underlying ETF, subject to its investment strategies and policies, </FONT>may invest in repurchase agreements with commercial banks,
brokers or dealers to generate income from its excess cash balances. A repurchase agreement is an agreement under which an Underlying
ETF acquires a financial instrument (e.g., a security issued by the U.S. government or an agency thereof, a banker&rsquo;s acceptance
or a certificate of deposit) from a seller, subject to resale to the seller at an agreed upon price and date (normally, the next
Business Day). A &ldquo;Business Day&rdquo; is any day on which the New York Stock Exchange (&ldquo;NYSE&rdquo;) is open for regular
trading. A repurchase agreement may be considered a loan collateralized by securities. The resale price reflects an agreed upon
interest rate effective for the period the instrument is held by an Underlying ETF and is unrelated to the interest rate on the
underlying instrument.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">In these repurchase agreement transactions,
the securities acquired by an Underlying ETF (including accrued interest earned thereon) must have a total value in excess of the
value of the repurchase agreement and are held by the Fund&rsquo;s custodian bank until repurchased. No more than an aggregate
of 15% of an Underlying ETF&rsquo;s net assets will be invested in illiquid securities, including repurchase agreements having
maturities longer than seven days and securities subject to legal or contractual restrictions on resale, or for which there are
no readily available market quotations.</P>

certain risks. For example, if the other party to the agreement defaults on its obligation to repurchase the underlying security
at a time when the value of the security has declined, an Underlying ETF may incur a loss upon disposition of the security. If
the other party to the agreement becomes insolvent and subject to liquidation or reorganization under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code
or other laws, a court may determine that the underlying security is collateral for a loan by the Fund not within the control of
such Underlying ETF and, therefore, the Fund may not be able to substantiate its interest in the underlying security and may be
deemed an unsecured creditor of the other party to the agreement.</P>

dollar roll transaction involves a sale by an Underlying ETF of a security concurrently with an agreement by the Fund to repurchase
a similar security at a later date at an agreed-upon price. A dollar roll may be considered a borrowing giving rise to leverage.
The securities that are repurchased will bear the same interest rate and a similar maturity as those sold, but the assets collateralizing
these securities may have different prepayment histories than those sold. During the period between the sale and repurchase, the
Fund will not be entitled to receive interest and principal payments on the securities sold. Proceeds of the sale will be invested
in additional investments, and the income from these investments will generate income for the Fund. If such income does not exceed
the income, capital appreciation and gain or loss that would have been realized on the securities sold as part of the dollar roll,
the use of this technique will diminish the investment performance of the Fund compared with what the performance would have been
without the use of dollar rolls. Dollar rolls involve the risk that the market value of the securities subject to an Underlying
ETF&rsquo;s forward purchase commitment may decline below, or the market value of the securities subject to an Underlying ETF&rsquo;s
forward sale commitment may increase above, the exercise price of the forward commitment. In the event the buyer of the securities
files for bankruptcy or becomes insolvent, an Underlying ETF&rsquo;s use of the proceeds of the current sale portion of the transaction
may be restricted.</FONT></P>

an IPO, are derived from a SPAC, or are derived from a de-SPAC business combination. These companies may be unseasoned and lack
a trading history, a track record of reporting to investors, and widely available research coverage. IPOs and stocks derived from
SPACs or de-SPAC business combination are thus often subject to extreme price volatility and speculative trading. These stocks
may have above-average price appreciation in connection with the IPO or relevant transaction prior to an Underlying ETF&rsquo;s
purchase. The price of stocks selected may not continue to appreciate and the performance of these stocks may not replicate the
performance exhibited in the past. In addition, IPOs and stocks derived from SPACs or de-SPACS business combinations may share
similar illiquidity risks of private equity and venture capital. The ownership of many IPOs and stocks derived from SPACS or de-SPACs
often includes large holdings by venture capital and private equity investors who seek to sell their shares in the public market
in the months following an IPO or relevant transaction when shares restricted by lock-up are released, causing greater volatility
and possible downward pressure during the time that locked-up shares are released.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">In addition, SPAC risks include potential
pricing misalignment. Further, less-publicly available information exists regarding SPACs than that which is available in connection
with traditional IPOS. Early investors in a SPAC may invest on the reputation of the sponsor, which may not reflect the value of
the target company. SPACs are speculative investments and are subject to conflicts of interest and fraud risks. SPAC trading pricings,
including market prices, may fluctuate significantly. An Underlying ETF may invest in a SPAC at a higher price which would reduce
the return to shareholders. SPACs may invest proceeds in U.S. treasuries. SPACS produce no income. SPACs have little to no liquidity
and often trade at a discount to their net asset values.</P>

strategies and policies, may invest directly in foreign securities or have indirect exposure to foreign securities. Investing in
securities of foreign companies and countries involves certain considerations and risks that are not typically associated with
investing in U.S. government securities and securities of domestic companies. There may be less publicly available information
about a foreign issuer than a domestic one, and foreign companies are not generally subject to uniform accounting, auditing and
financial standards, and requirements comparable to those applicable to U.S. companies. There may also be less government supervision
and regulation of foreign securities exchanges, brokers, and listed companies than exists in the United States. Interest and dividends
paid by foreign issuers as well as gains or proceeds realized from the sale or other disposition of foreign securities may be subject
to withholding and other foreign taxes, which may decrease the net return on such investments as compared to dividends and interest
paid to the Underlying ETFs by domestic companies or the U.S. government. There may be the possibility of expropriations, seizure
or nationalization of foreign deposits, the imposition of economic sanctions, confiscatory taxation, political, economic or social
instability, or diplomatic developments that could affect assets of the Underlying ETFs held in foreign countries. The establishment
of exchange controls or other foreign governmental laws or restrictions could adversely affect the payment of obligations. In addition,
investing in foreign securities will generally result in higher commissions than investing in similar domestic securities.</P>

Developing or emerging market countries may be more likely to impose government restrictions, including confiscatory taxation,
expropriation or nationalization of a company&rsquo;s assets, and restrictions on foreign ownership of local companies. In addition,
emerging markets may impose restrictions on an Underlying ETF&rsquo;s ability to repatriate investment income or capital and, thus,
may adversely affect the operations of the Underlying ETFs. Certain emerging markets may impose constraints on currency exchange
and some currencies in emerging markets may have been devalued significantly against the U.S. dollar. For these and other reasons,
the prices of securities in emerging markets can fluctuate more significantly than the prices of securities of companies in developed
countries. The less developed the country, the greater effect these risks may have on the Underlying ETFs.</FONT></P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">An Underlying ETF, subject to its investment
strategies and policies, may invest in short-term instruments, including money market instruments, on an ongoing basis to provide
liquidity or for other reasons. Money market instruments are generally short-term investments that may include but are not limited
to: (i) shares of money market funds; (ii) obligations issued or guaranteed by the U.S. government, its agencies or instrumentalities
(including government-sponsored enterprises); (iii) negotiable certificates of deposit (&ldquo;CDs&rdquo;), bankers&rsquo; acceptances,
fixed time deposits and other obligations of U.S. and foreign banks (including foreign branches) and similar institutions; (iv)
commercial paper rated at the date of purchase &ldquo;Prime-1&rdquo; by Moody&rsquo;s Investors Service or &ldquo;A-1&rdquo; by
Standard &amp; Poor&rsquo;s Financial Services or, if unrated, of comparable quality as determined by the Adviser; (v) non-convertible
corporate debt securities (e.g., bonds and debentures) with remaining maturities at the date of purchase of not more than 397 days
and that satisfy the rating requirements set forth in Rule 2a-7 under the 1940 Act; and (vi) short-term U.S. dollar denominated
obligations of foreign banks (including U.S. branches) that, in the opinion of the Adviser, are of comparable quality to obligations
of U.S. banks which may be purchased by an Underlying ETF. Any of these instruments may be purchased on a current or a forward-settled
basis. Money market instruments also include shares of money market funds. Time deposits are non-negotiable deposits maintained
in banking institutions for specified periods of time at stated interest rates. Bankers&rsquo; acceptances are time drafts drawn
on commercial banks by borrowers, usually in connection with international transactions.&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">The Fund (and certain Underlying ETFs)
may lend portfolio securities to certain creditworthy borrowers. The borrowers provide collateral that is maintained in an amount
at least equal to the current value of the securities loaned. The Fund (or Underlying ETF) may terminate a loan at any time and
obtain the return of the securities loaned. The Fund (or Underlying ETF) receives the value of any interest or cash or non-cash
distributions paid on the securities that it lends. Distributions received on loaned securities in lieu of dividend payments (i.e.,
substitute payments) would not be considered qualified dividend income.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">With respect to loans that are collateralized
by cash, the borrower will be entitled to receive a fee based on the amount of cash collateral. The Fund (or Underlying ETF) is
compensated by the difference between the amount earned on the reinvestment of cash collateral and the fee paid to the borrower.
In the case of collateral other than cash, the Fund is compensated by a fee paid by the borrower equal to a percentage of the value
of the loaned securities. Any cash collateral may be reinvested in certain short-term instruments either directly on behalf of
The Fund (or Underlying ETF) or through one or more joint accounts or money market funds, which may include those managed by the
Adviser.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">The Fund (or Underlying ETF) may pay a
portion of the interest or fees earned from securities lending to a borrower as described above, and to one or more securities
lending agents approved by the Board who administer the lending program for the Fund in accordance with guidelines approved by
the Board. In such capacity, the lending agent causes the delivery of loaned securities from the Fund (or Underlying ETF) to borrowers,
arranges for the return of loaned securities to the Fund (or Underlying ETF) at the termination of a loan, requests deposit of
collateral, monitors the daily value of the loaned securities and collateral, requests that borrowers add to the collateral when
required by the loan agreements, and provides recordkeeping and accounting services necessary for the operation of the program.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">Securities lending involves exposure to
certain risks, including operational risk (i.e., the risk of losses resulting from problems in the settlement and accounting process),
&ldquo;gap&rdquo; risk (i.e., the risk of a mismatch between the return on cash collateral reinvestments and the fees the Fund
(or Underlying ETF) has agreed to pay a borrower), and credit, legal, counterparty and market risk. In the event a borrower does
not return the Fund&rsquo;s (or Underlying ETF&rsquo;s) securities as agreed, the Fund (or Underlying ETF) may experience losses
if the proceeds received from liquidating the collateral do not at least equal the value of the loaned security at the time the
collateral is liquidated plus the transaction costs incurred in purchasing replacement securities.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify"><B>Board Responsibilities.</B> The Board
oversees the management and operations of the Trust. Like all mutual funds, the day-to-day management and operation of the Trust
is the responsibility of the various service providers to the Trust, such as the Adviser, the Distributor, the Administrator, the
Custodian, and the Transfer Agent, each of whom is discussed in greater detail in this Statement of Additional Information. The
Board has appointed various senior employees of the Administrator as officers of the Trust, with responsibility to monitor and
report to the Board on the Trust&rsquo;s operations. In conducting this oversight, the Board receives regular reports from these
officers and the service providers. For example, the Treasurer reports as to financial reporting matters and the President reports
as to matters relating to the Trust&rsquo;s operations. In addition, the Adviser provides regular reports on the investment strategy
and performance of the Fund. The Board has appointed a Chief Compliance Officer who administers the Trust&rsquo;s compliance program
and regularly reports to the Board as to compliance matters. These reports are provided as part of formal &ldquo;Board Meetings&rdquo;
which are typically held quarterly, in person, and involve the Board&rsquo;s review of recent operations. In addition, various
members of the Board also meet with management in less formal settings, between formal &ldquo;Board Meetings,&rdquo; to discuss
various topics. In all cases, however, the role of the Board and of any individual Trustee is one of oversight and not of management
of the day-to-day affairs of the Trust and its oversight role does not make the Board a guarantor of the Trust&rsquo;s investments,
operations or activities.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">As part of its oversight function, the
Board receives and reviews various risk management reports and discusses these matters with appropriate management and other personnel.
Because risk management is a broad concept comprised of many elements (e.g., investment risk, issuer and counterparty risk, compliance
risk, operational risks, business continuity risks, etc.), the oversight of different types of risks is handled in different ways.
For example, the Audit Committee meets with the Treasurer and the Trust&rsquo;s independent public accounting firm to discuss,
among other things, the internal control structure of the Trust&rsquo;s financial reporting function.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">The full Board also receives reports from
the Adviser as to investment risks of the Fund. In addition to these reports, from time to time the full Board receives reports
from the Administrator and the Adviser as to enterprise risk management.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">The Board recognizes that not all risks
that may affect the Fund can be identified and/or quantified, that it may not be practical or cost-effective to eliminate or mitigate
certain risks, that it may be necessary to bear certain risks (such as investment-related risks) to achieve the Fund&rsquo;s goals,
and that the processes, procedures, and controls employed to address certain risks may be limited in their effectiveness. Moreover,
reports received by the Board as to risk management matters are typically summaries of the relevant information. Most of the Fund&rsquo;s
investment management and business affairs are carried out by or through the Adviser, Sub-Adviser, and other service providers,
each of which has an independent interest in risk management but whose policies and the methods by which one or more risk management
functions are carried out may differ from the Fund&rsquo;s and each other&rsquo;s in the setting of priorities, the resources available,
or the effectiveness of relevant controls. As a result of the foregoing and other factors, the Board&rsquo;s ability to monitor
and manage risk, as a practical matter, is subject to limitations.</P>

Ms. Byrd is chair of the Audit Committee, and she presides at the Audit Committee meetings, participates in formulating agendas
for Audit Committee meetings, and coordinates with management to serve as a liaison between the Independent Trustees and management
on matters within the scope of responsibilities of the Audit Committee as set forth in its Board-approved written charter. The
principal responsibilities of the Audit Committee include overseeing the Trust&rsquo;s accounting and financial reporting policies
and practices and its internal controls; overseeing the quality, objectivity and integrity of the Trust&rsquo;s financial statements
and the independent audits thereof; monitoring the independent auditor&rsquo;s qualifications, independence, and performance; acting
as a liaison between the Trust&rsquo;s independent auditors and the full Board; pre-approving all auditing services to be performed

report or related work; pre-approving all permitted non-audit services (including the fees and terms thereof) to be performed for
the Trust; pre-approving all permitted non-audit services to be performed for any investment adviser or sub-adviser to the Trust

accounting controls and Trust management&rsquo;s responses thereto, and (4) review the form of opinion the independent auditors
propose to render to the Board and the Fund&rsquo;s shareholders; discussing with management and the independent auditor significant
financial reporting issues and judgments made in connection with the preparation of the Fund&rsquo;s financial statements; and
reviewing and discussing reports from the independent auditors on (1) all critical accounting policies and practices to be used,

Qualified Legal Compliance Committee (&ldquo;QLCC&rdquo;) for the Trust for the purpose of compliance with Rules 205.2(k) and 205.3(c)
of the Code of Federal Regulations, regarding alternative reporting procedures for attorneys retained or employed by an issuer
who appear and practice before the SEC on behalf of the issuer (the &ldquo;issuer attorneys&rdquo;). An issuer attorney who becomes
aware of evidence of a material violation by the Trust, or by any officer, director, employee, or agent of the Trust, may report
evidence of such material violation to the QLCC as an alternative to the reporting requirements of Rule 205.3(b) (which requires
reporting to the chief legal officer and potentially escalating further to other entities). As of the date of this SAI, the QLCC
has not met with respect to the Trust.</P>

The Board has a standing Nominating and Governance Committee that is composed of each of the Independent Trustees of the Trust.
The Nominating and Governance Committee operates under a written charter approved by the Board. The Nominating and Governance Committee
is responsible for seeking and reviewing candidates for consideration as nominees for Trustees as is considered necessary from
time to time and meets only as necessary. The Nominating and Governance Committee generally will not consider nominees recommended
by shareholders. The Nominating and Governance Committee is also responsible for, among other things, assisting the Board in its
oversight of the Trust&rsquo;s compliance program under Rule 38a-1 under the 1940 Act, reviewing and making recommendations regarding
Independent Trustee compensation and the Trustees&rsquo; annual &ldquo;self-assessment.&rdquo; Ms. Cryton is the chair of the Nominating
and Governance Committee. The Nominating Committee and Governance Committee meets periodically, as necessary, but at least annually.
As of the date of this SAI, the Nominating and Governance Committee met [one] time with respect to the Trust. Because the Fund
has not yet commenced operations, the Nominating and Governance Committee has not yet met or taken any action with respect to the
Fund as of the date of the SAI.</P>

management fee, which is calculated daily and paid monthly, at an annual rate of [ ]% based on the Fund&rsquo;s average daily net

Interest</B>. The portfolio managers&rsquo; management of &ldquo;other accounts&rdquo; may give rise to potential conflicts of
interest in connection with their management of the Fund&rsquo;s investments, on the one hand, and the investments of the other
accounts, on the other. The other accounts may have similar investment objectives or strategies as the Fund. A potential conflict
of interest may arise as a result, whereby a portfolio manager could favor one account over another. Another potential conflict
could include a portfolio manager&rsquo;s knowledge about the size, timing, and possible market impact of Fund trades, whereby
a portfolio manager could use this information to the advantage of other accounts and to the disadvantage of the Fund. For instance,
the portfolio managers may receive fees from certain accounts that are higher than the fees received from the Fund, or receive
a performance-based fee on certain accounts. In those instances, a portfolio manager has an incentive to favor the higher and/or
performance-based fee accounts over the Fund. To mitigate these conflicts, the Adviser has established policies and procedures
to ensure that the purchase and sale of securities among all accounts the firms manage are fairly and equitably allocated.</P>

The Adviser, or its affiliates, out of their own resources and not out of Fund assets (i.e., without additional cost to the Fund

for certain activities related to the Fund, including participation in activities that are designed to make Intermediaries more
knowledgeable about exchange traded products, including the Fund, or for other activities, such as marketing and educational training
or support. These arrangements are not financed by the Fund and, thus, do not result in increased Fund expenses. They are not reflected
in the fees and expenses listed in the fees and expenses sections of the Fund&rsquo;s Prospectus and they do not change the price
paid by investors for the purchase of Shares or the amount received by a shareholder as proceeds from the redemption of Shares.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">Such compensation may be paid to Intermediaries
that provide services to the Fund, including marketing and education support (such as through conferences, webinars, and printed
communications). The Adviser will periodically assess the advisability of continuing to make these payments. Payments to an Intermediary
may be significant to the Intermediary, and amounts that Intermediaries pay to your adviser, broker, or other investment professional,
if any, may also be significant to such adviser, broker, or investment professional. Because an Intermediary may make decisions
about what investment options it will make available or recommend, and what services to provide in connection with various products,
based on payments it receives or is eligible to receive, such payments create conflicts of interest between the Intermediary and
its clients. For example, these financial incentives may cause the Intermediary to recommend the Fund over other investments. The
same conflict of interest exists with respect to your financial adviser, broker, or investment professional if they receive similar
payments from their Intermediary firm.</P>

Plan (&ldquo;Disinterested Trustees&rdquo;). None of the Trustees have a direct or indirect financial interest in the Plan or in
any agreements related to the Plan. The Plan may be continued from year-to-year only if the Board, including a majority of the
Disinterested Trustees, concludes at least annually that continuation of the Plan is likely to benefit shareholders. The Board
has determined that the Plan is likely to benefit the Fund by providing an incentive for brokers, dealers, and other financial
intermediaries to engage in sales and marketing efforts on behalf of the Fund and to provide enhanced services to shareholders.
The Board also determined that the Plan may enhance the Fund&rsquo;s ability to sell shares and access important distribution channels.</P>

and insurance companies including, without limit, investment counselors, broker-dealers, and the Distributor&rsquo;s affiliates

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">The policy of the Trust regarding purchases
and sales of securities for the Fund is that primary consideration will be given to obtaining the most favorable prices and efficient
executions of transactions. Consistent with this policy, when securities transactions are effected on a stock exchange, the Trust&rsquo;s
policy is to pay commissions which are considered fair and reasonable without necessarily determining that the lowest possible
commissions are paid in all circumstances. The Trust believes that a requirement always to seek the lowest possible commission
cost could impede effective portfolio management and preclude the Fund and the Adviser from obtaining a high quality of brokerage
and research services. In seeking to determine the reasonableness of brokerage commissions paid in any transaction, the Adviser
will rely upon its experience and knowledge regarding commissions generally charged by various brokers and on its judgment in evaluating
the brokerage services received from the broker effecting the transaction. Such determinations are necessarily subjective and imprecise,
as in most cases, an exact dollar value for those services is not ascertainable. The Trust has adopted policies and procedures
that prohibit the consideration of sales of Shares as a factor in the selection of a broker or dealer to execute its portfolio
transactions.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">The Adviser owes a fiduciary duty to its
clients to seek to provide best execution on trades effected. In selecting a broker/ dealer for each specific transaction, the
Adviser chooses the broker/dealer deemed most capable of providing the services necessary to obtain the most favorable execution.
&ldquo;Best execution&rdquo; is generally understood to mean the most favorable cost or net proceeds reasonably obtainable under
the circumstances. The full range of brokerage services applicable to a particular transaction may be considered when making this
judgment, which may include, but is not limited to liquidity, price, commission, timing, aggregated trades, capable floor brokers
or traders, competent block trading coverage, ability to position, capital strength and stability, reliable and accurate communications
and settlement processing, use of automation, knowledge of other buyers or sellers, arbitrage skills, administrative ability, underwriting,
and provision of information on a particular security or market in which the transaction is to occur. The specific criteria will
vary depending upon the nature of the transaction, the market in which it is executed, and the extent to which it is possible to
select from among multiple broker/ dealers. The Adviser will also use electronic crossing networks (&ldquo;ECNs&rdquo;) when appropriate.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">Subject to the foregoing policies, brokers
or dealers selected to execute the Fund&rsquo;s portfolio transactions may include the Fund&rsquo;s Authorized Participants (as
discussed in &ldquo;Purchase and Redemption of Shares in Creation Units &mdash; Procedures for Purchase of Creation Units&rdquo;
below) or their affiliates. An Authorized Participant or its affiliates may be selected to execute the Fund&rsquo;s portfolio transactions
in conjunction with an all-cash Creation Unit order or an order including &ldquo;cash-in-lieu&rdquo; (as described below under
&ldquo;Purchase and Redemption of Shares in Creation Units&rdquo;), so long as such selection is in keeping with the foregoing
policies. As described below under &ldquo;Purchase and Redemption of Shares in Creation Units &mdash; Creation Transaction Fee&rdquo;
and &ldquo; &mdash; Redemption Transaction Fee&rdquo;, the Fund may determine to not charge a variable fee on certain orders when
the Adviser has determined that doing so is in the best interests of Fund shareholders, even if the decision to not charge a variable
fee could be viewed as benefiting the Authorized Participant or its affiliate selected to execute the Fund&rsquo;s portfolio transactions
in connection with such orders.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">The Adviser may use the Fund&rsquo;s assets
for, or participate in, third-party soft dollar arrangements, in addition to receiving proprietary research from various full-service
brokers, the cost of which is bundled with the cost of the broker&rsquo;s execution services. The Adviser does not &ldquo;pay up&rdquo;
for the value of any such proprietary research. Section 28(e) of the 1934 Act permits the Adviser under certain circumstances,
to cause the Fund to pay a broker or dealer a commission for effecting a transaction in excess of the amount of commission another
broker or dealer would have charged for effecting the transaction in recognition of the value of brokerage and research services
provided by the broker or dealer. The Adviser may receive a variety of research services and information on many topics, which
it can use in connection with its management responsibilities with respect to the various accounts over which it exercises investment
discretion or otherwise provides investment advice. The research services may include qualifying order management systems, portfolio
attribution and monitoring services, and computer software and access charges which are directly related to investment research.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">Accordingly, the Fund may pay a broker
commission higher than the lowest available in recognition of the broker&rsquo;s provision of such services to the Adviser but
only if the Adviser determines the total commission (including the soft dollar benefit) is comparable to the best commission rate
that could be expected to be received from other brokers. The amount of soft dollar benefits received depends on the amount of
brokerage transactions effected with the brokers. A conflict of interest exists because there is an incentive to (1) cause clients
to pay a higher commission than the firm might otherwise be able to negotiate, (2) cause clients to engage in more securities transactions
than would otherwise be optimal, and (3) only recommend brokers that provide soft dollar benefits.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">The Adviser faces a potential conflict
of interest when it uses client trades to obtain brokerage or research services. This conflict exists because the Adviser can use
the brokerage or research services to manage client accounts without paying cash for such services, which reduces the Adviser&rsquo;s
expenses to the extent that the Adviser would have purchased such products had they not been provided by brokers. Section 28(e)
permits the Adviser to use brokerage or research services for the benefit of any account it manages. Certain accounts managed by
the Adviser may generate soft dollars used to purchase brokerage or research services that ultimately benefit the Adviser, the
Affiliates, or other accounts managed by the Adviser, effectively cross subsidizing the other accounts managed by the Adviser that
benefit directly from the product. The Adviser may not necessarily use all of the brokerage or research services in connection
with managing the Fund whose trades generated the soft dollars used to purchase such products.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">The Adviser is responsible, subject to
oversight by the Board, for placing orders on behalf of the Fund for the purchase or sale of portfolio securities. If purchases
or sales of portfolio securities of the Fund and one or more other investment companies or clients supervised by the Adviser or
any other Affiliate are considered at or about the same time, transactions in such securities are allocated among them in a manner
deemed equitable and consistent with relevant fiduciary obligations. In some cases, this procedure could have a detrimental effect
on the price or volume of the security so far as the Fund is concerned. However, in other cases, it is possible that the ability
to participate in volume transactions and to negotiate lower brokerage commissions will be beneficial to the Fund. The primary
consideration is prompt execution of orders at the most favorable net price.</P>

The Fund may execute brokerage or other agency transactions through registered broker-dealer affiliates of the Fund or the Adviser
for a commission in conformity with the 1940 Act, the 1934 Act and rules promulgated by the SEC. These rules require that commissions
paid to the affiliate by the Fund for exchange transactions not exceed &ldquo;usual and customary&rdquo; brokerage commissions.
The rules define &ldquo;usual and customary&rdquo; commissions to include amounts which are &ldquo;reasonable and fair compared

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">A portfolio turnover rate is, in summary,
the percentage computed by dividing the lesser of the Fund&rsquo;s purchases or sales of securities (excluding short-term securities
and securities transferred in-kind) by the average market value of the Fund. A rate of 100% indicates that the equivalent of all
of the Fund&rsquo;s assets have been sold and reinvested in a year. High portfolio turnover may affect the amount, timing and character
of distributions, and, as a result, may increase the amount of taxes payable by shareholders. Higher portfolio turnover also results
in higher transaction costs. To the extent that net short-term capital gains are realized by the Fund, any distributions resulting
from such gains are considered ordinary income for federal income tax purposes.</P>

There are certain legal risks unique to investors purchasing Creation Units directly from the Fund. Because Shares may be issued
on an ongoing basis, a &ldquo;distribution&rdquo; of Shares could be occurring at any time. Certain activities that a shareholder
performs as a dealer could, depending on the circumstances, result in the shareholder being deemed a participant in the distribution
in a manner that could render the shareholder a statutory underwriter and subject to the prospectus delivery and liability provisions
of the Securities Act. For example, a shareholder could be deemed a statutory underwriter if it purchases Creation Units from the
Fund, breaks them down into the constituent Shares, and sells those Shares directly to customers, or if a shareholder chooses to
couple the creation of a supply of new Shares with an active selling effort involving solicitation of secondary-market demand for
Shares. Whether a person is an underwriter depends upon all of the facts and circumstances pertaining to that person&rsquo;s activities,
and the examples mentioned here should not be considered a complete description of all the activities that could cause you to be
deemed an underwriter.</P>

by dividing the value of the net assets of the Fund (<I>i.e.</I>, the value of its total assets less total liabilities) by the
total number of Shares outstanding, rounded to the nearest cent. Expenses and fees, including the management fees, are accrued
daily and taken into account for purposes of determining NAV. The NAV of the Fund is calculated by Global Fund Services and determined
at the scheduled close of the regular trading session on the NYSE (ordinarily 4:00 p.m., Eastern Time) on each day that the NYSE
is open, provided that fixed-income assets may be valued as of the announced closing time for trading in fixed-income instruments

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">In calculating the Fund&rsquo;s NAV per
Share, the Fund&rsquo;s investments are generally valued using pricing services. The Fund may use various pricing services, or
discontinue the use of any pricing service, as approved by the Adviser from time to time. A price obtained from a pricing service
based on such pricing service&rsquo;s valuation matrix may be considered a market valuation. Any assets or liabilities denominated
in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are converted into U.S. dollars at the current market rates on the date of valuation as
quoted by one or more sources. For assets traded on an exchange, the Fund may value investments using market valuations. A market
valuation generally means a valuation (1) obtained from an exchange, a pricing service, or a major market maker (or dealer), (2)
based on a price quotation or other equivalent indication of value supplied by an exchange, a pricing service, or a major market
maker (or dealer) or (3) based on amortized cost. In the case of shares of other funds that are not traded on an exchange, a market
valuation means such fund&rsquo;s published NAV per share.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">The tax legislation commonly referred to
as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the &ldquo;Tax Act&rdquo;) made significant changes to the U.S. federal income tax rules for taxation
of individuals and corporations, generally effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. Many of the changes applicable
to individuals are temporary and would apply only to taxable years before January 1, 2026. There were only minor changes with respect
to the specific rules applicable to RICs, such as the Fund. The Tax Act, however, also made numerous other changes to the tax rules
that may affect shareholders and the Fund. Subsequent legislation has modified certain changes to the U.S. federal income tax rules
made by the Tax Act which may, in addition, affect shareholders and the Fund. You are urged to consult with your own tax advisor

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify"><B>Taxation of the Fund.</B> The Fund will
elect and intends to qualify each year to be treated as a RIC under the Code. As such, the Fund should not be subject to federal
income taxes on its net investment income and capital gains, if any, to the extent that it timely distributes such income and capital
gains to its shareholders. Generally, to be taxed as a RIC, the Fund must distribute in each taxable year at least 90% of its &ldquo;investment
company taxable income&rdquo; (before the deduction for dividends paid) for the taxable year, which includes, among other items,
dividends, interest, net short-term capital gain, and net foreign currency gain, less expenses, as well as 90% of its net tax-exempt
interest income, if any (the &ldquo;Distribution Requirement&rdquo;) and also must meet several additional requirements. Among
these requirements are the following: (1) at least 90% of the Fund&rsquo;s gross income each taxable year must be derived from
dividends, interest, payments with respect to certain securities loans, gains from the sale or other disposition of stock, securities,
or foreign currencies, or other income derived with respect to its business of investing in such stock, securities, or foreign
currencies, and net income derived from interests in qualified publicly traded partnerships (the &ldquo;Qualifying Income Requirement&rdquo;);
and (2) at the end of each quarter of the Fund&rsquo;s taxable year, the Fund&rsquo;s assets must be diversified so that (a) at
least 50% of the value of the Fund&rsquo;s total assets is represented by cash and cash items, U.S. government securities, securities
of other RICs, and other securities, with such other securities limited, in respect to any one issuer, to an amount not greater
in value than 5% of the value of the Fund&rsquo;s total assets and to not more than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of
such issuer, and (b) not more than 25% of the value of its total assets is invested in the securities (other than U.S. government
securities or securities of other RICs) of any one issuer, the securities (other than securities of other RICs) of two or more
issuers which the Fund controls and which are engaged in the same, similar, or related trades or businesses, or the securities
of one or more qualified publicly traded partnerships (the &ldquo;Diversification Requirement&rdquo;).</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">To the extent the Fund makes investments
that may generate income that is not qualifying income, including certain derivatives, the Fund will seek to restrict the resulting
income from such investments so that the Fund&rsquo;s non-qualifying income does not exceed 10% of its gross income.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">Although the Fund intends to distribute
substantially all of its net investment income and may distribute its capital gains for any taxable year, the Fund will be subject
to federal income taxation to the extent any such income or gains are not distributed. The Fund is treated as a separate corporation
for federal income tax purposes. The Fund therefore is considered to be a separate entity in determining its treatment under the
rules for RICs described herein. The requirements (other than certain organizational requirements) for qualifying RIC status are
determined at the Fund level rather than at the Trust level.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">If the Fund fails to satisfy the Qualifying
Income Requirement or the Diversification Requirement in any taxable year, the Fund may be eligible for relief provisions if the
failures are due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect and if a penalty tax is paid with respect to each failure to satisfy
the applicable requirements. Additionally, relief is provided for certain <I>de minimis </I>failures of the Diversification Requirement
where the Fund corrects the failure within a specified period of time. To be eligible for the relief provisions with respect to
a failure to meet the Diversification Requirement, the Fund may be required to dispose of certain assets. If these relief provisions
were not available to the Fund and it were to fail to qualify for treatment as a RIC for a taxable year, all of its taxable income
would be subject to tax at regular corporate rates without any deduction for distributions to shareholders, and its distributions
(including capital gains distributions) generally would be taxable to the shareholders of the Fund as ordinary income dividends,
subject to the dividends received deduction for corporate shareholders and the lower tax rates on qualified dividend income received
by noncorporate shareholders, subject to certain limitations. To requalify for treatment as a RIC in a subsequent taxable year,
the Fund would be required to satisfy the RIC qualification requirements for that year and to distribute any earnings and profits
from any year in which the Fund failed to qualify for tax treatment as a RIC. If the Fund failed to qualify as a RIC for a period
greater than two taxable years, it would generally be required to pay a fund-level tax on certain net built in gains recognized
with respect to certain of its assets upon disposition of such assets within five years of qualifying as a RIC in a subsequent
year. The Board reserves the right not to maintain the qualification of the Fund for treatment as a RIC if it determines such course
of action to be beneficial to shareholders. If the Fund determines that it will not qualify as a RIC, the Fund will establish procedures
to reflect the anticipated tax liability in the Fund&rsquo;s NAV.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">The Fund may elect to treat part or all
of any &ldquo;qualified late year loss&rdquo; as if it had been incurred in the succeeding taxable year in determining the Fund&rsquo;s
taxable income, net capital gain, net short-term capital gain, and earnings and profits. The effect of this election is to treat
any such &ldquo;qualified late year loss&rdquo; as if it had been incurred in the succeeding taxable year in characterizing Fund
distributions for any calendar year. A &ldquo;qualified late year loss&rdquo; generally includes net capital loss, net long-term
capital loss, or net short-term capital loss incurred after October 31 of the current taxable year, subject to special rules in
the event the Fund makes an election under Section 4982(e)(4) of the Code, (commonly referred to as &ldquo;post-October losses&rdquo;),
and certain other late-year losses.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">Capital losses in excess of capital gains
(&ldquo;net capital losses&rdquo;) are not permitted to be deducted against a RIC&rsquo;s net investment income. Instead, for U.S.
federal income tax purposes, potentially subject to certain limitations, the Fund may carry a net capital loss from any taxable
year forward indefinitely to offset its capital gains, if any, in years following the year of the loss. To the extent subsequent
capital gains are offset by such losses, they will not result in U.S. federal income tax liability to the Fund and may not be distributed
as capital gains to its shareholders. Generally, the Fund may not carry forward any losses other than net capital losses. The carryover
of capital losses may be limited under the general loss limitation rules if the Fund experiences an ownership change as defined
in the Code.</P>

net capital gain as deemed distributions in a notice to its shareholders, who (i) will be required to include in income for U.S.
federal income tax purposes, as long-term capital gain, their proportionate shares of the undistributed amount so designated, (ii)
will be entitled to credit their proportionate shares of the income tax paid by the Fund on that undistributed amount against their

as a RIC or a REIT may be treated as qualified dividend income generally only to the extent so reported by such ETF, underlying
fund or REIT. If 95% or more of the Fund&rsquo;s gross income (calculated without taking into account net capital gain derived

of the Fund&rsquo;s investments may be subject to complex provisions of the Code (including provisions relating to hedging transactions,
straddles, integrated transactions, foreign currency contracts, forward foreign currency contracts, and notional principal contracts)
that, among other things, may affect the Fund&rsquo;s ability to qualify as a RIC, affect the character of gains and losses realized
by the Fund (<I>e.g.</I>, may affect whether gains or losses are ordinary or capital), accelerate recognition of income to the
Fund and defer losses. These rules could therefore affect the character, amount and timing of distributions to shareholders. These
provisions also may require the Fund to mark to market certain types of positions in its portfolio (<I>i.e</I>., treat them as
if they were closed out) which may cause the Fund to recognize income without the Fund receiving cash with which to make distributions
in amounts sufficient to enable the Fund to satisfy the RIC distribution requirements for avoiding Fund-level income and excise
taxes. The Fund intends to monitor its transactions, intends to make appropriate tax elections, and intends to make appropriate
entries in its books and records to mitigate the effect of these rules and preserve the Fund&rsquo;s qualification for treatment
as a RIC. To the extent the Fund invests in an underlying fund that is taxable as a RIC, the rules applicable to the tax treatment
of complex securities will also apply to the underlying funds that also invest in such complex securities and investments.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify"><B>Foreign Investments by the Fund</B>.
Interest and other income received by the Fund with respect to foreign securities may give rise to withholding and other taxes
imposed by foreign countries. Tax treaties or conventions between certain countries and the United States may reduce or eliminate
such taxes. If, as of the close of a taxable year, more than 50% of the value of the Fund&rsquo;s assets consists of certain foreign
stock or securities, the Fund will be eligible to elect to pass through to investors the amount of certain qualifying foreign income
and similar taxes paid by the Fund during that taxable year. This means that investors would be considered to have received as
additional income their respective shares of such foreign taxes, but may be entitled to either a corresponding tax deduction in
calculating taxable income, or, subject to certain limitations, a credit in calculating federal income tax. If the Fund does not
so elect, the Fund will be entitled to claim a deduction for certain foreign taxes incurred by the Fund. The Fund (or its administrative
agent) will notify you if it makes such an election and provide you with the information necessary to reflect foreign taxes paid
on your income tax return.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify"><B>Backup Withholding.</B> The Fund will
be required in certain cases to withhold (as &ldquo;backup withholding&rdquo;) on amounts payable to any shareholder who (1) fails
to provide a correct taxpayer identification number certified under penalty of perjury; (2) is subject to backup withholding by
the IRS for failure to properly report all payments of interest or dividends; (3) fails to provide a certified statement that they
are not subject to &ldquo;backup withholding;&rdquo; or (4) fails to provide a certified statement that they are a U.S. person
(including a U.S. resident alien). The backup withholding rate is at a rate set under Section 3406 of the Code. Backup withholding
is not an additional tax and any amounts withheld may be credited against the shareholder&rsquo;s ultimate U.S. federal income
tax liability. Backup withholding will not be applied to payments that have been subject to the 30% withholding tax on shareholders
who are neither citizens nor permanent residents of the United States.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify"><B>Non-U.S. Shareholders.</B> Any non-U.S.
investors in the Fund may be subject to U.S. withholding and estate tax and are encouraged to consult their tax advisors prior
to investing in the Fund. Foreign shareholders (<I>i.e.</I>, nonresident alien individuals and foreign corporations, partnerships,
trusts and estates) are generally subject to a U.S. withholding tax at the rate of 30% (or a lower tax treaty rate) on distributions
derived from taxable ordinary income. The Fund may, under certain circumstances, report all or a portion of a dividend as an &ldquo;interest-related
dividend&rdquo; or a &ldquo;short-term capital gain dividend,&rdquo; which would generally be exempt from this 30% U.S. withholding
tax, provided certain other requirements are met. Short-term capital gain dividends received by a nonresident alien individual
who is present in the U.S. for a period or periods aggregating 183 days or more during the taxable year are not exempt from this
30% withholding tax. Gains realized by foreign shareholders from the sale or other disposition of Shares generally are not subject
to U.S. taxation, unless the recipient is an individual who is physically present in the U.S. for 183 days or more per year (based
on a formula that factors in presence in the U.S. during the two preceding years as well). Foreign shareholders who fail to provide
an applicable IRS form may be subject to backup withholding on certain payments from the Fund. Backup withholding will not be applied
to payments that are subject to the 30% (or lower applicable treaty rate) withholding tax described in this paragraph. Different
tax consequences may result if the foreign shareholder is engaged in a trade or business within the United States. In addition,
the tax consequences to a foreign shareholder entitled to claim the benefits of a tax treaty may be different than those described
above.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">Under the Foreign Account Tax Compliance
Act (&ldquo;FATCA&rdquo;), the Fund may be required to withhold a generally nonrefundable 30% tax on distributions of net investment
income paid to (a) certain &ldquo;foreign financial institutions&rdquo; unless such foreign financial institution agrees to verify,
monitor, and report to the IRS the identity of certain of its account holders, among other items (or unless such entity is otherwise
deemed compliant under the terms of an intergovernmental agreement between the United States and the foreign financial institution&rsquo;s
country of residence), and (b) certain &ldquo;non-financial foreign entities&rdquo; unless such entity certifies to the Fund that
it does not have any substantial U.S. owners or provides the name, address, and taxpayer identification number of each substantial
U.S. owner, among other items. This FATCA withholding tax could also affect the Fund&rsquo;s return on its investments in foreign
securities or affect a shareholder&rsquo;s return if the shareholder holds its Fund shares through a foreign intermediary. You
are urged to consult your tax adviser regarding the application of this FATCA withholding tax to your investment in the Fund and
the potential certification, compliance, due diligence, reporting, and withholding obligations to which you may become subject
in order to avoid this withholding tax.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">For foreign shareholders to qualify for

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify"><B>Tax-Exempt Shareholders. </B>Certain
tax-exempt shareholders, including qualified pension plans, individual retirement accounts, salary deferral arrangements, 401(k)
plans, and other tax-exempt entities, generally are exempt from federal income taxation, except with respect to their unrelated
business taxable income (&ldquo;UBTI&rdquo;). Tax-exempt entities are generally not permitted to offset losses from one unrelated
trade or business against the income or gain of another unrelated trade or business. Certain net losses incurred prior to January
1, 2018 are permitted to offset gain and income created by an unrelated trade or business, if otherwise available. Under current
law, the Fund generally serves to block UBTI from being realized by its tax-exempt shareholders with respect to their shares of
Fund income. However, notwithstanding the foregoing, tax-exempt shareholders could realize UBTI by virtue of their investment in
the Fund if, for example, (1) the Fund invests in residual interests of Real Estate Mortgage Investment Conduits (&ldquo;REMICs&rdquo;),
(2) the Fund invests in a REIT that is a taxable mortgage pool (&ldquo;TMP&rdquo;) or that has a subsidiary that is a TMP or that
invests in the residual interest of a REMIC, or (3) Shares in the Fund constitute debt-financed property in the hands of the tax-exempt
shareholders within the meaning of section 514(b) of the Code. Charitable remainder trusts are subject to special rules and should
consult their tax advisers. The IRS has issued guidance with respect to these issues and prospective shareholders, especially charitable
remainder trusts, are strongly encouraged to consult with their tax advisers regarding these issues.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify"><B>Certain Potential Tax Reporting Requirements.</B>
Under U.S. Treasury regulations, if a shareholder recognizes a loss on disposition of the Shares of $2 million or more for an individual
shareholder or $10 million or more for a corporate shareholder (or certain greater amounts over a combination of years), the shareholder
must file with the IRS a disclosure statement on IRS Form 8886. Direct shareholders of portfolio securities are in many cases excepted
from this reporting requirement, but under current guidance, shareholders of a RIC are not excepted. Significant penalties may
be imposed for the failure to comply with the reporting requirements. The fact that a loss is reportable under these regulations
does not affect the legal determination of whether the taxpayer&rsquo;s treatment of the loss is proper. Shareholders should consult
their tax advisors to determine the applicability of these regulations in light of their individual circumstances.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify"><B>Foreign Investments.</B>&nbsp;Dividends
and interest received by the Fund from sources within foreign countries may be subject to withholding and other taxes imposed by
such countries. Tax treaties between certain countries and the U.S. may reduce or eliminate such taxes. The Funds do not expect
to satisfy the requirements for passing through to their shareholders any share of foreign taxes paid by the Fund, with the result
that shareholders will not include such taxes in their gross incomes and will not be entitled to a tax deduction or credit for
such taxes on their own tax returns.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">If the Fund holds shares in a &ldquo;passive
foreign investment company&rdquo; (&ldquo;PFIC&rdquo;), it may be subject to U.S. federal income tax on a portion of any &ldquo;excess
distribution&rdquo; or gain from the disposition of such shares even if such income is distributed as a taxable dividend by the
Fund to its shareholders. Additional charges in the nature of interest may be imposed on the Fund in respect of deferred taxes
arising from such distributions or gains.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">The Fund may be eligible to treat a PFIC
as a &ldquo;qualified electing fund&rdquo; (&ldquo;QEF&rdquo;) under the Code in which case, in lieu of the foregoing requirements,
the Fund will be required to include in income each year a portion of the ordinary earnings and net capital gains of the qualified
electing fund, even if not distributed to the Fund, and such amounts will be subject to the 90% and excise tax distribution requirements
described above. To make this election, the Fund would be required to obtain certain annual information from the PFICs in which
it invests, which may be difficult or impossible to obtain. Alternatively, the Fund may make a mark-to-market election that will
result in the Fund being treated as if it had sold and repurchased its PFIC stock at the end of each year. In such case, the Fund
would report any gains resulting from such deemed sales as ordinary income and would deduct any losses resulting from such deemed
sales as ordinary losses to the extent of previously recognized gains. The election must be made separately for each PFIC owned
by the Fund and, once made, is effective for all subsequent taxable years, unless revoked with the consent of the IRS. By making
the election, the Fund could potentially ameliorate the adverse tax consequences with respect to its ownership of shares in a PFIC,
but in any particular year may be required to recognize income in excess of the distributions it receives from PFICs and its proceeds
from dispositions of PFIC stock. The Fund may have to distribute this excess income to satisfy the 90% distribution requirement
and to avoid imposition of the 4% excise tax. To distribute this income and avoid a tax at the Fund level, the Fund might be required
to liquidate portfolio securities that it might otherwise have continued to hold, potentially resulting in additional taxable gain
or loss. Amounts included in income each year by the Fund arising from a QEF election will be &ldquo;qualifying income&rdquo; under
the Qualifying Income Requirement (as described above) even if not distributed to the Fund, if the Fund derives such income from
its business of investing in stock, securities or currencies.</P>

to Rule 484 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act), the Registrant furnishes the following undertaking:
Insofar as indemnification for liability arising under the Securities Act of 1933 may be permitted to trustees, officers and controlling
persons of the Registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, the Registrant has been advised that, in the opinion
of the Securities and Exchange Commission such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and
is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by
the Registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a trustee, officer or controlling person of the Registrant in the successful defense
of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such trustee, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities
being registered, the Registrant will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent,
submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed
in the Securities Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.</FONT></P>
