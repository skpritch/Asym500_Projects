The swaps provide returns to the Fund that are based on model portfolios generated by the quantitative investment strategies.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">&#160;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin-top: 0pt; text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0pt">Quantitative investment strategies (or &#8220;QIS&#8221;) are third-party investment strategies that analyse historical quantitative data and use models to identify investments that based on historical results can provide attractive risk adjusted returns. The Adviser evaluates multiple strategies and selects the individual strategies based on multiple qualitative and quantitative considerations, including portfolio diversification, scalability, expected risk adjusted returns and correlation to one another. By using a multi-strategy approach, the Fund&#8217;s Adviser seeks to identify the optimal allocation among 10-20 strategies to achieve positive returns and mitigate asset-class and single-strategy risks. The Adviser evaluates strategies on an ongoing basis and makes adjustments to the strategy allocations when the Adviser believes an alternative strategy would provide better returns.</P>

Ordinary gains on swaps are generally considered income to the Fund, contribute to the income component of the Fund&#8217;s investment objective and are considered absolute positive returns. Other investments that contribute to income include treasuries and income-generating collateral.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin-top: 0pt; text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0pt">The Fund may also gain exposure to equity, fixed income, commodity, currency, and volatility markets by investing in other ETFs or individual securities. The equity and fixed income strategies include primarily U.S. companies but may include companies from both emerging and developed foreign markets and may include companies of any market capitalization. The fixed income strategies may include high yield (&#8220;junk bond&#8221;) strategies, and strategies of any duration or maturity. The commodity strategies may include all types of commodities and commodity indexes. Currency strategies are those that attempt to profit from the changes in the relative value of various currencies. Volatility strategies are those that attempt to profit from the changes in the historical or implied return volatility of futures or securities indexes. Volatility is when a security experiences periods of unpredictable, and sometimes sharp, price movements.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin-top: 0pt; text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0pt"><I>Equity Securities Risk. </I>Equity securities are susceptible to general stock market fluctuations and to volatile increases and decreases in value.

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin-top: 0pt; text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0pt"><I>Fixed Income Securities Risk</I>. When the Fund invests in fixed income securities, the value of your investment in the Fund will fluctuate with changes in interest rates. Typically, a rise in interest rates causes a decline in the value of fixed income securities owned by the Fund. In general, the market price of fixed income securities with longer maturities will increase or decrease more in response to changes in interest rates than shorter-term securities. Other risk factors include credit risk (the debtor may default), extension risk (an issuer may exercise its right to repay principal on a fixed rate obligation held by the Fund later than expected), and prepayment risk (the debtor may pay its obligation early, reducing the amount of interest payments).</P>

Changes in currency exchange rates and the relative value of non-U.S. currencies will affect the value of the Fund&#8217;s investment and the value of Fund shares. Currency exchange rates can be very volatile and can change quickly and unpredictably. As a result, the value of an investment in the Fund may change quickly and without warning and your investment in the Fund may experience losses.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin-top: 0pt; text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0pt"><I>Foreign Exchange Risk</I>. Because options held by the Fund may trade on foreign exchanges that are closed when the Fund&#8217;s primary listing exchange is open, there are likely to be deviations between the current price of a security and the security&#8217;s last quoted price from the closed foreign market. This may result in premiums and discounts that are greater than those experienced by domestic ETFs.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin-top: 0pt; text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0pt"><I>Futures Risk.</I> The Fund&#8217;s use of futures involves risks different from, or possibly greater than, the risks associated with investing directly in securities and other traditional investments. These risks include (i) leverage risk (ii) risk of mispricing or improper valuation; and (iii) the risk that changes in the value of the futures contract may not correlate perfectly with the underlying index. Investments in futures involve leverage, which means a small percentage of assets invested in futures can have a disproportionately large impact on the Fund. This risk could cause the Fund to lose more than the principal amount invested. Futures contracts may become mispriced or improperly valued when compared to the adviser&#8217;s expectation and may not produce the desired investment results. Additionally, changes in the value of futures contracts may not track or correlate perfectly with the underlying index because of temporary, or even long-term, supply and demand imbalances and because futures do not pay dividends unlike the stocks upon which they are based.&#8221;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin-top: 0pt; text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0pt"><I>Small and Medium Capitalization Risk. </I>The earnings and prospects of small and medium sized companies are more volatile than larger companies and may experience higher failure rates than larger companies. Small and medium sized companies normally have a lower trading volume than larger companies, which may tend to make their market price fall more disproportionately than larger companies in response to selling pressures and may have limited markets, product lines, or financial resources and lack management experience.</P>
