The Underlying Index is designed to minimize the inflation risk of a portfolio composed of U.S. dollar-denominated, investment-grade bonds, which is represented in the Underlying Index by the Underlying Fund, by including a series of up to 10 inflation swap contracts with different maturities (as determined by BlackRock Index Services, LLC (the “Index Provider”)). As of May 9, 2022, the Underlying Index includes inflation risk at key points on the yield curve, as determined by the Index Provider. The Underlying Index includes a fixed number of shares (to be adjusted in the event of any stock splits) of the Underlying Fund, and the Index Provider rebalances the weights of the swap contracts included in the Underlying Index daily. On a monthly basis, the Index Provider will add new swap contracts to the Underlying Index and remove the previous month’s swap contracts. The Fund seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing, under normal circumstances, at least 80% of its net assets, plus the amount of any borrowings for investment purposes, in component securities and instruments in the Fund’s Underlying Index. Cash and cash equivalent investments associated with a derivative position will be treated as part of that position for the purposes of calculating the percentage of investments included in the Underlying Index. The Fund may also invest in other instruments designed to transfer inflation risk from one party to another, including but not limited to U.S. Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (“TIPS”), total return swaps, futures and options (collectively with inflation swaps, “inflation hedging instruments”). The Fund’s investments in inflation hedging instruments are not intended to mitigate credit risk or other factors influencing the price of U.S. dollar-denominated, investment-grade bonds, which may have a greater impact than inflation rates. Moreover, to the extent that inflation risk has been priced into the U.S. dollar-denominated, investment-grade bonds owned by the Underlying Fund, the Fund will underperform the Underlying Fund even during inflationary periods. BFA uses a representative sampling indexing strategy to manage the Fund and the Underlying Fund. “Representative sampling” is an indexing strategy that involves investing in a representative sample of securities and/or other instruments that collectively have an investment profile similar to that of an applicable underlying index. The securities and/or other instruments selected are expected to have, in the aggregate, investment characteristics (based on factors such as market value and industry weightings), fundamental characteristics (such as return variability, duration, maturity, credit ratings and yield) and liquidity measures similar to those of an applicable underlying index. The Fund or the Underlying Fund may or may not hold all of the securities and/or other instruments in the applicable Underlying Index. The Fund may lend securities from its portfolio representing up to one-third of the value of the Fund’s total assets or the value of the collateral received.", "source_file": "agih_497k.pdf"}
